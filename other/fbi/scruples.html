It was hard growing up an only child.&nbsp; When I was 3 my parents were killed
by a 30 pound Pitt bull.&nbsp; The memories are faint, all I can remember is
crawling in to a small hole in a building wall.&nbsp; I was scared, and all
alone, and remained between the walls for about 2 day.&nbsp; One day a young
lady was walking by an must have hear my soft wimpers.&nbsp; She stopped,
and held out her hand.&nbsp; She took me to her home, which was out in the
country.&nbsp; A beautiful place, well secluded from the rest of the world.&nbsp;
It was there that my life changed dramatically.<P>

Under the care of this young lady I learned many new skills, that would become
useful in my future.&nbsp; I learned the fine arts of taping phone lines,
killing with out a trace of evidence, and hand to hand combat.&nbsp; At the
age of 19, I enrolled in the college of electronics.<P>

Shortly after completing the college course, I started making bombs.&nbsp; I will always remember
my first bomb, and the unsuspecting people.&nbsp; Their faces when they saw
what was happening was near the same look my parents made when they were
being eaten alive by these people's dog.&nbsp; Although the people were old
and in their 70's, I felt no pain by making them suffer the way my parents
had.&nbsp; I will never forget the faces of any of them as they suffered.<P>

Once I turned 21, I was ask to join the FBI. Under the guidance of Captain
Caffianted Hallmark, I spent months training.&nbsp; I learned to apply the
skills my second mother had taught me, and take them into real life
situations.&nbsp; I learned  to be the lean mean Agent that I am
today.<P>

Being one of the younger agents on staff with the FBI,
I have much time to gain more and more skills, and become on of the best
agents around.&nbsp; At this point in time my only fear is the fear of
corruption.&nbsp; My young mind is still gullable, and there are many
ways that I can be affected working in the agency.&nbsp; With my self
control I hope to over come this fear.&nbsp; It can be done!&nbsp;
My goal in life is to help Captain Caffianted Hallmark take over the
world.<P>

We will suceed!
