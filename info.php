Way back when, I owned a 1972 Chevy Chevelle. Since I sold it I regret doing so and own many pieces of Chevelle memorabilia. This includes a model and a hat both with red Chevelles on them. Since then I have used Redchevelle as my Internet alias.</TD></TR></TABLE></DIV>

<DD>Well here is a page that will let you know who the hell I am. I figured it was about time to let everyone in on the big secret. lol How should I lay this all out?? Should it be like a story?<P>

<B><I>It all started in 1973...</I></B><P>

Nah! I guess I'll just spit it all out and you try and
make sense of it.  he he<P>

I started on computers in 1989 on a 286SX 16. Right away I took to the Graphic end of it and learned how to use Harvard Graphics quite a bit.<P>

There are times I wished I had wanted to learn programing, mostly when I hear the  huge difference in pay.  Grrr But hey, I love what I do, right?!?<P>

After years of tinkering with computers, I decided to go to school to become a computer technician. I spent 2 years in <A HREF="http://www.compucollege.ca/">Compucollege</A> and gained much knowledge in both computers and in what I wanted to do with them.<P>

Yipper, I should have taken computer graphics! I am a graphic artist at heart and I guess will always be. In 1997, after a few years on the Internet, I founded the company Gallant Web Design, and have been designing graphics and web pages ever since.<P>

<DT><B>April 25th, 1999</B><BR>
<DD>Wow! things have certainly changed for me since July 13, 1998 when I wrote that.  I am currently enrolled in <A HREF="http://www.mun.ca/">Memorial University of Newfoundland (MUN)</A> doing a <A HREF="http://www.cs.mun.ca/">Computer Science</A> Degree.  You guessed it, I am learning to become a programmer.  Also, I will be doing an area known to be one of the toughest in Computer Science, that is Graphics.  This is becoming like a diary for me.<P>

<DT><B>September 8, 1999</B><BR>
<DD>And again things have changed.  After completing 2 semesters of MUN, I have decided it's not the right path for me at this time.  I mean 5 years and another $50,000 on loans!  Who am I kidding.  So I am open for work once again.  Email me if you would like graphics or webpage design at its best by Ron.
