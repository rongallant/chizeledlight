Stoneroids98
		v1.07 Overview
		
		
			Stoneroids98 is a Java
			applet that is loosely based on the classic arcade
			game, Asteroids. The goal of course, is to destroy
			the asteroids and enemy ships. Stoneroids98
			adds to this new features like various types of
			weapons, alien intelligence, and powerups. Also there
			is an automatic high scoring system available, which
			is rare in Java applets (due to the security
			limitations in Java applets). Unlike Asteroids, you
			don't die instantly once you hit something --
			Stoneroids98 is based on a shield system,
			and the game is over once your shield runs out.

Scoring System
		
		
			The scoring system quite complex,
				which adds variety to the game. However, here are
				some general patterns in scoring...
			Asteroids: Point
				value depends on size and speed, which measures
				how difficult they are to shoot. Smaller, faster
				asteroids yield the most points. Values usually
				range from 10-200 points.
			Comets: Appearing
				occasionally, the score of these bonus items are
				worth twice as much as their Asteroid brothers
				when shot, plus they hold at least one powerup.
				Values usually range between 50-200 points for
				each hit.
			Aliens: Since
				aliens can do many things you can do, they are
				worth more points if they do more stuff before
				they are killed. Their point value depends on
				game level and how much stuff they pick up or
				shoot. When an alien dies, they also drop any and
				all powerups they picked up along the way. Alien
				values are 50xlevel, plus points for other
				activities.
			Level Bonus: There
				is a standard end of level bonus which increases
				in later levels, plus bonus points for the amount
				of shields remaining and weapons owned.
			You LOSE 5 points
				every time you press the space bar to shoot. This
				is an incentive for you to NOT
				fire off as many rounds as possible. Five points
				is not a big deal as you'll quickly be reaping
				thousands of points.
			You LOSE 25 x
				Level points if you shoot a powerup.
				Obviously this is something you should try to
				avoid.
			You'll discover several other ways
				of scoring as well. Keep playing to find them
				all.
		
		






Various Targets
				
				
				Your Ship: Your
				mission? To stay alive against the countlessly
				outnumbered forces!
			
		
				 
				Aliens: Alien
				ships flying around just minding their own
				business, unless provoked.
				
				    
				
			
			Powerups: Various
				colored egg-shaped powerups. Fly over them to
				pick them up. Don't shoot these.
				
				  
				Asteroids: Those
				blue things floating around that you've gotta
				shoot.
				Comets: Just like asteroids, but
				with a comet's tail trailing behind them. They
				hold a powerup if you can hit the center.
			
				
				


				Powerup System
				

				
				
				Blue
				Powerup
				Shield Boost. Some extra
				shield energy for your ship.
			
			
				
				Green
				Powerup
				Energy Coolant Boost. Cools
				your laser temperature.
			
			
				
				Yellow
				Powerup
				Weapon Powerup. Various
				effects on your weapons. See Weapon System below...
			
			
				
				Red
				Powerup
				Sub-Zero Powerup. For a
				limited time, you can shoot as much as you want
				without heating up your lasers.
			
			
				
				Purple
				Powerup
				Invincibility Powerup. For a
				limited time, you are invincible and cannot be

		Weapon System
	
	
		
			
				
			

		
			1 - Single Shot. Your
				typical pea shooter weapon. You always have this
				weapon and it cannot be damaged.
			2 - Dual Shot. Two
				angled shots come out.
			3 - Tri Shot. Three
				shots as a combination of Single and Dual Shot.
				Available Level 2 or later.
			4 - Quad Shot. Same
				as the Tri Shot, but also one laser comes out
				from behind. Available Level 3 or later.
			5 - Square Shot. Four
				lasers come out from front, back, left and right
				sides. Available Level 4 or later.
			6 - Mega Shot. Most
				powerful weapon. Six lasers as a combination of
				the Tri Shot and Square Shot. Available Level 5
				or later.
			Damaged
				Weapons. Weapons
				other than # 1 can be damaged if you are hit when
				holding this weapon. A damaged weapon will glow RED
				in the user display. The weapon may malfunction
				when you try to shoot a damaged weapon. You can
				repair a damaged weapon if you get a weapon powerup while holding the damaged weapon.
			Heat
				Seeking Weapons. Beginning
				with Level 6, non-damaged weapons are upgraded to
				Heat Seeking status via a weapon powerup. A damaged weapon will glow BLUE in the user display. But you lose the
				Heat Seeking upgrade once you are hit. A Heat
				Seeking Mega Shot is the most powerful weapon in
				the game -- capable of wiping clean much of a
				level in a few moments. Oh yeah!
		
		
	

	
		Alien Ships
	
	
		
			In a way, alien ships are much
				like you. They fly around, have shield and energy, can build
				up their own scores as they shoot stuff, and can
				pick up powerups to upgrade themselves. But they
				are also after you.
			Enemy ships can also get Invulnerability if they get a Purple powerup, and even 							upgrade their lasers
				to Heat
				Seeking status if they get
				enough weapon
				powerups. You're in trouble
				if they upgrade to Heat Seeker lasers!
			Enemy ships don't need coolant and thus cannot overheat their lasers.
		

				
				The Rogue Ship
			
			
				Part of the enemy defense
				forces, these quick moving ships don't like you
				at all and gladly will use its weapon arsenal to
				erase you. They have single, twin or triple
				lasers, and have tough armor against asteroid
				impacts, but are weak against enemy lasers.
			
			
				
				
			
			
				
				The Miner Ship
			
			
				Originally working in the
				asteroid mines, they have been called into
				service to destroy you. They are generally slower
				and don't always chase after you. They have much
				tougher armor than the Rogues and are invincible
				to asteroid collisions. Their mild weaponry
				consists of only a single laser. However their
				real danger comes into play when they pick up
				small asteroids with their large claws and hurl
				them towards you at high speeds. They may seem
				harmless at first, but they can quickly be a
				force to be reckoned with!

			Stoneroids98 always
				attempts to stabilize your frame rates to about
				20 fps regardless of how fast your system is.
				Still expect about 20 fps. Slower systems should
				see numbers less than 20fps. Example, a P-90 will
				average around 12 fps. A P-166 and up should get
				20 fps.
			High scores are not always
				available. If they are disabled then you won't be
				able to see them.
		
		
	





	
		Other Tips
	
	
		
			You get an &quot;extra life&quot;
				at 5000, 10000, 15000, 20000 and every 10000
				thereafter. It's not really an extra life, but
				more like a refresh. Your shield and energy coolant are
				completely restored, plus you recieve one random
				powerup.
			You cannot damage your # 1 Laser.
				This includes if you upgrade the # 1 Laser to Heat
				Seeking status. This means you can have a
				permanent Heat Seeking weapon even after you get
				hit. Quite powerful.
			You get double points for
				asteroids you destroy just after they are born.
				For example, if you hit a large asteroid with a
				Tri Shot, one laser will hit the large asteroid,
				splitting it. The other two may hit the new
				smaller rocks and will get double score for them!
			Every time you or an alien gets damaged, the ship gets
			a brief moment of invinciblity to recover -- at the expense
			of heating
				up the lasers. The ship is invulnerable to any
				impacts during this brief moment, except for Heat Seeking weapons. Heat Seekers can cut through
				enemy forces like butter, invulnerable or not.
			Damage from colliding with an
				asteroid is proportional to its size. Don't run
				into the big ones or you'll be dead in no time.
			Have trouble flying the ship?
				Don't fly so fast. Use short controlled bursts
				when moving around.
			Have trouble overheating your
				lasers too fast? Don't shoot so much. Collisions
				quickly contribute to overheated lasers so also watch what you bump into.
			Try to cool down your lasers just
				before you destroy the last target in a level.
				That way you'll enter the next level without
				worrying about overheating right
				away.
			Have trouble scoring enough
				points? Can't really help you there except
				practice, practice, practice.
		
		Expert Player's Tips
		
			When swarmed by lots of aliens,
				concentrate on the laser-shooting Rogue aliens,
				not the rock-throwing Miners. The Rogues are more
				dangerous to you in the short run, plus they are
				easier to destroy especially with heat seeker weapons.
			As you grab a weapon powerup, your selected weapon has first
				priority in getting repaired or upgraded to seekers. Tip? First select a weapon that's damaged or want to upgrade to seekers, then get the powerup.
			Start your levels using your most
				powerful weapon. At first, blast as many of the
				large asteroids as you can without getting hit.
				If you think you'll get hit or start to overheat,
				switch to a smaller weapon. Advantage? You get to
				use that powerful weapon again in the next
				level!!
