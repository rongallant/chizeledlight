<A HREF="links.php"><B>links</B></A> - Here is a small portion of my bookmarks which I hope you will find usefull. I also have links to my friends pages and most of mine.<P>

<A HREF="tolkien.php"><B>J.R.R. Tolkien</B></A> - This is where I stash all
my links to my favorite author. If you haven't read <I>Lord of the Rings</I>
yet, get it, read it, and love it.<P>

<A HREF="pink_floyd.php"><B>Pink Floyd</B></A> - I fell in love with the music of
Pink Floyd some ten years ago. It all began when I borrowed a tape off
a friend called Works. I am now a huge floydian (Pink Floyd fan) and want
everyone to share the experience.<P>

<A HREF="knives.php"><B>Art Knives</B></A> - A little appreciated form of art is
the art of knife making. Maybe the first tool ever created by man, it has 
over the years grown from a simple tool, to a way for people to express themselves
creatively.<P>
