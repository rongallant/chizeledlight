<h1>Information</h1>

<p>I hope that you found both the information and my teaching style in our first three lessons to be easy, enjoyable and fun.</p>
      
<p>All of my lessons have lots of new information that build on the last lesson, but the steps will be small so you won't get lost.</p>

<p>And, unlike a lesson from a live teacher at a music store, you can refer to these lessons as many times as you want, any time you want. No schedules, no appointments and no hassles.</p>
      
<p>It's fast, easy, convenient and fun.</p>
      
<p>I hope you are among the many players that I've heard from that like my style of teaching.</p>
      
<p>Here's what some of the players had to say:</p>
      
<blockquote>"I enjoyed your lessons tremendously! I definitely intend to stay tuned."</blockquote>
     
<blockquote>"Your lessons are great...it's so much nicer when things are explained in an easy, down-to-earth manner."</blockquote>

<blockquote>"I just wanted to say how nice it is for someone to help out new players like this. I have been playing for some years now, but     when I started I wished I could find something like this! Thanks for all the help."</blockquote>

<blockquote>"I really appreciate your +positive+ attitude towards learning."</blockquote>

<blockquote>"I've messed with guitar for 20 years on and off, and still learned plenty from your lessons. Excellent!"</blockquote>

<blockquote>"I just picked up my first guitar, found your site, now I am playing blues like someone at it for a few years! Great course Jim."</blockquote>

<p>My primary goal is to help you learn to play the guitar faster and to have more fun doing it.</p>

<p>Learning the guitar is supposed to be fast, easy and fun...not slow, difficult, stressful and frustrating.</p>

<p>And, you'll really be surprised at how much you'll learn when you can practice at your own pace, anytime you want, playing along to your favorite songs and having a great time doing it.</p>

<p>You'll learn, note-by-note, the easy way to play lead solos made famous by legends like Eric Clapton, SRV, Rick Derringer, Johnny Winter, Freddie King, Albert Collins, Buddy Guy and many more.</p>

<p>Like Lessons One, Two and Three, everything is made super-easy for you to ROAR and SOAR into the essence of the Blues.</p>

<p>Many computer users have to pay to stay logged on, some get disconnected frequently, and others are not familiar with downloading files or other computer-related tasks.  Others only have internet access at school or work.</p>

<p>So, to solve all of these hassles, I'll send your lessons to you via email. (It is also available on disk and CD.)</p>

<p>With one mouse click, you have instant access, plus you can quickly find a favorite lesson, riff or chord. It's fast, easy, convenient and fun.  You can practice and jam anytime, anywhere.</p>

<p>Plus, you get to play what *you* want to play.</p>

<p>I can't afford to send them out for free, as I have to assemble them and pay for my internet time and other costs.</p>

<p>But, I can do my very best to make the series of lessons very affordable for everyone.</p>

<p>So, I'm sending the three lessons on this site, plus three more lessons, plus one more very special item, all via email for only $15.</p>

<p>If you think that $15 is too much to pay for all 6 of these lessons, please look around and you'll find sites that offer these same types of lessons, in the same format, for $30.00 EACH, payable in advance.</p>

<p>So, to pay $15 for lessons that cost $180.00 or more elsewhere is a fair and affordable way to learn. In brief, you save over $160.00.  And, unlike some other guitar teachers, I will never waste your time or try to keep you buying lessons for months or years.  Life is too short for that stuff.</p>

<p>One purchase of $15 delivers it ALL directly to you, FAST!  With each lesson you'll learn more tips, techniques, chords, licks and leads.</p>

<p>In fact, Lesson Six alone includes OVER 1,500 CHORDS...plus *exactly* how to play each one!</p>

<p>I call this my "Master List," as you'll never have to "figure out" how to play a chord again for the rest of your life. You'll "Master" them all!</p>

<p>PLUS, to say "Thank You" for supporting BLUES SCHOOL, you will also receive detailed photos of each of the chords used in our lessons!  You'll learn even faster than ever!</p>

<p>You will receive:</p>

<ul>
	<li><b>Lesson One</b> Chords, "Sliders", Basic Blues/Rock and more
	<li><b>Lesson Two</b> Strings, Necks, Pickups, Bends and more
	<li><b>Lesson Three</b> Famous Signature Licks and more

	<li><b>PLUS</b> detailed photos of our special "blues chords"!                                     
</ul>
