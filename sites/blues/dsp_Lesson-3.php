<H1>Lesson 3</H1>

<P>Lesson Three is a continuation from Lesson Two.  I divided Lesson Two for several reasons:  First, Lesson Two was getting too long.  I did not want to  encourage you to try to learn too much at one time. Secondly, we were beginning a transition from making your guitar easier to play to playing "signature"  licks and other riffs.  These riffs get more and more difficult, so I decided to back off just a little bit.</P>

<P>It's much easier to learn one thing at a time, rather than learn a bunch of things at once.  This way, you'll  retain much more of what you have learned and you will also be able to play it better and faster. Now, I know that you would like the chords and even the turnaround at the end.  So, let's boogie onward:</P>

 <P>NOTE: The "official" names for these chords may vary.    But, you can debate that with music theory fans in the future...for now, let's use easy names.</P>

</PRE>

<P>Yes, even our simple B7 is hard to play, but please stay with me...I've got an easier chord that sounds even better!</P>

<P>But first, the "turnaround"...that's how we end the verse and "turn around" to the next verse:</P>

<P>HERE'S THE TURNAROUND...PLAY IT ON THE FRETS SHOWN, then on the 2nd fret, the 1st, then E.</P>

<P>Pick the G string downward, then the B string upward...and walk it down, fret by fret to an E.</P>

<P>Again, that's G string downstroke/B string upstroke 3rd fret,<BR>
......then  G string downstroke/B string upstroke 2nd fret,<BR>
......then  G string downstroke/B string upstroke 1st fret,<BR>
......then the E chord.</P>

<P>Give it a try, you've heard it a million times!</P>

<PRE WIDTH="30">

            E  A  D  G  B  E<BR>

</PRE>

<P>Remember to walk it down: downstroke, upstroke, 3rd fret, 2nd fret, 1st fret, E. </P> 

<P>Again, it helps to have it on CD, if you're not familiar with it.  If you don't have it, borrow it.  If you can't borrow it, buy it...it's a great CD.  If you still don't have it, try Audionet.  If absolutely all else fails,  contact me and I'll put it on a .wav for you.  I would  attach a .wav here, but it would really push the envelope on the length of this post, plus most players know the song.</P>

<P>Now, it's time for our:</P>

<PRE WIDTH="30">
  "Texas Special" pseudo B9th turnaround chord,<BR>
   to replace that wimpy B7th we used before:

     (top of guitar..where strings end)<BR>
         (the little strings)<BR>

            E  A  D  G  B  E<BR>
            X<BR>            
                  1          1st fret<BR>
               2     3  3  3 2nd fret<BR>
                             3rd fret<BR>
                             4th fret<BR>
     (this way to the higher frets)
</PRE>

<P>NOTE: It sounds even better if you slide this entire chord from the 3rd fret to the second, for a blues turnaround. That is, play in on the 4th fret, then, while it is still making noise, drop it to the 3rd fret.</P>

<P>Just one more quick note:  In case this famous turnaround sounds kind of familiar, it is also used as the beginning for songs like "Sweet Home Chicago" (Buddy Guy, Koko Taylor, Blues Brothers,
etc.) and "I Got Everything I Need (Almost)," and other old blues 
tunes.</P>

<P>Whew...I don't know about you, but this has been a lot of stuff to try to learn at once.</P>

<P>Had enough?  No? </P> 

<P>OK.....</P>

<P>Want to try something more in the Texas blues style?</P>

<P>Let's play our lick, except start it on the 15th fret and then to the 14th, 13th and 12th.  Same key (E) just one octave higher.  Here it is again:</P>

<PRE WIDTH="30">
    (top of guitar..where strings end)<BR>
(the big strings)       (the little strings)<BR><BR>

      "Our Texas-style turnaround lick"

            E  A  D  G  B  E<BR>
            x  x  x        x<BR>            
                             13th fret<BR>
                             14th fret<BR>
                        1    15th fret<BR>
                     2       16th fret<BR>           
     (this way to the higher frets)<BR>
</PRE>

<P>It's the same lick, still in E, just one octave higher...great on electric...a stretch on acoustic.</P>

<P>Pick the G string downward, then the B string upward...and walk it down, fret by fret to an E.</P>

<P>Again, that's G string downstroke/B string upstroke 15th fret,<BR>
.....then  G string downstroke/B string upstroke 14th fret,<BR>
.....then  G string downstroke/B string upstroke 13th fret,<BR>
.....then  G string downstroke/B string upstroke 12th fret.<BR>
        And, finally, our Texas-style B9 turnaround chord:</P>

<PRE WIDTH="30">
  "Texas Special" pseudo B9th turnaround chord<BR>
   to replace that wimpy B7th we used before:

     (top of guitar..where strings end)<BR>
(the big strings)       (the little strings)<BR>

            E  A  D  G  B  E<BR>
            X<BR>            
                  1          1st fret<BR>
               2     3  3  3 2nd fret<BR>
                             3rd fret<BR>
                             4th fret<BR>
     (this way to the higher frets)<BR><BR>
</PRE>

<P>REMEMBER: It sounds even better if you slide this entire chord  from the 3rd fret to the second, for a blues turnaround. That is, play in on the 3rd fret, then, while it is still making noise, drop it to the 2nd fret.</P>

<P>Try playing the above 2-note lick on the 3rd fret, as shown above and then, while it is still making noise, slide it up to the 15th fret...how many times have you  heard that one, a zillion?</P>

<P>That's right...play it on the 3rd fret, then slide it up to the 15th fret...same downstroke then upstroke...</P>

<P>Yeah, you're playin' the blues now, my friend!  And, you're in good company...Clapton loves it, too.  In fact, play it in rock and you're playin' old Clapton jam material from "Sunshine of Your Love."</P>

<P>Hey, wow, we're sure come a long way from that one E chord we learned, right?  Well, I guess it's time to call it a night....what?</P>

<P>STILL in the mood to get crazy....OK....just don't hurt me, you blues animal!!  Earplugs on, Scotty!!</P>

<P>Got distortion, overdrive and a slide (even though not needed)?  Place your index finger over both the B and E strings, hit them together, slide them up to the 12th fret and hit them again and again, either together or with the same downstroke/upstroke.</P>

<P>Now, while you're up on that 12th fret, try to move that index finger in place...a little finger vibrato.</P>

<P>Alright!  Ya know what?  You're GOOD!!!! </P>

<P>You've got the intro to "Dust My Broom" (I do kind of  believe the original was recorded in 1934 by Elmore James, but I know it's been worked endlessly by Clapton, King, Winter, Collins, etc.).  Remember, you are only hitting two strings here, all the rest are not played.  I believe this is also the first tune in Clapton's "From the Cradle" CD.</P>

<P>In all sincerity..you *really* should be wearing sunglasses
by now..I mean, even my computer keyboard is SMOKIN'!!!!!!</P>


<P>OK, that's enough.  Time to take a break and call it a day.  You've done great and I'm really proud of you. I can't stress enough how important practice is to.............what.....??</P>

<P>Still in the mood?  Need a big ending for this session?</P>

<P>So, maybe it's time to call it quits.....whoa.....ok....don't threaten me.....you're so hot on that guitar that you're starting to scare me.</P>

<P>You demand one final lick?</P>

<P>You got it! </P> 

<P>OK, for a final touch, again, cover both the B and E strings with your index finger, not playing any other strings and hit them together on these frets: 12th, 10th,  7th,  5th,  3rd,  2nd,  3rd,  5th,  7th, 10th,  7th,   10th,  7th,  10th,  7th,  10th,  12th,  14th, 15th,  17th,  19th,  17th,  15th,  14th,  12th,  10th,  12th... feel free to keep slidin' around.</P>

<P>Sounds great for doin' it the first time.  Try it again. Kind of slide from one fret position to another...that's right...downstrokes and slide, downstrokes and slide.</P>

<P>Sounds kind of "funky"...but, keep messin' with it, ok? I would like for you to simply notice how a simple "slider" can be moved all over the fretboard to produce something that sounds very difficult to play to the average listener.</P>  

<P>Got it..or at least the general idea of moving the same  position all over the fretboard? OK!</P>

<P ALIGN="center">C O N G R A T U L A T I O N S ! ! !</P>

<P>You've just played a good hunk of the fantastic solo of the 16-minute version of "Rock n Roll Hoochie Koo" a la Rick Derringer from "Live in Cleveland." You know, the famous, "lawdy momma, lawdy momma,  lawdy mommaaaaaaaaaaaaa, light my fuse" part. </P>

<P>BUT, we STILL need a tasty blues chord to finish with..hummm..</P>

<P>Alright, finish it off with this chord on the frets shown... (no official names, it just sounds nice...call it a "kind of blues E9 with a twist," at least for now):</P>

<PRE WIDTH="30">
      "Kind of a Blues E9 with a Twist"<BR><BR>

     (top of guitar..where strings end)<BR>

                           4 9th fret<BR>
      (this way to the higher frets)<BR><BR>
</PRE>

<P>Now, was that "tasteful" or what?  Classy!</P>

<P>WARNING: By now, you are playing so hot that you might  qualify for spontaneous combustion and your guitar  neck is SMOKIN'!!!!</P>

<P>So you might want to save your fingertips for now and call it a day...before the neighbors call the police.</P>

<P>I just don't want your fingers to get sore, ok?</P>

<P>I apologize for pushing a little bit there at the end, but I wanted you to start to fall into the groove of just how simply all of these bits and pieces can be put together.</P>

<P>I sincerely hope that it wasn't too much.  If so, just  kind of put your mind in rewind and try some more...some people learn faster than others and this lesson was bordering on full-tilt.  So, don't feel weird that some of this didn't
hit you like a brick the first time around.  I mean, we covered a LOT of territory this time.</P>

<P>Think about it.</P>

<P>Man, we have covered a LOT of ground, from getting your axe in shape to messing with picks and learning licks!</P>  <P>Remember to put the lemon oil on the shopping list, just mention that you have suddenly gained an appreciation for  fine furniture. </P> 

<P>Just think how much you have learned since the beginning of this lesson!</P>

<P>You've really learned a lot, really fast!</P>

<P>Our next lesson?  Well, looks to me like you're ready to learn some leads and some more information about the blues.</P>

<P>The sessions in our 6-lesson set end up running over 150 pages and include over 1,500 chords, plus even more material.</P>

<P>The problem is that I don't have the space to post over 150 pages on this site, so I have to offer them via email.</P>

<P>If you're interested, please just click along to the "Information" page. </P>

<P>If you decide to continue on your own from here, that's great. I really hope that I was able to help a little.</P>  

<P>Just remember, if you need resources, you can  always check the "Blues Links" page.</P>  

<P>And, you know that you're always welcome here at <I>Jim's Blues School.</I> </P>

<P>Be well, my friend, and take care.</P>

<P>Well, it's time to close up the old tweed case, let the tubes begin to cool down and call it a night.</P>

<P ALIGN="center"><I>Stay in touch and stay in tune! Keep the Blues alive!</I></P>

<P>Sincerely,</P>
