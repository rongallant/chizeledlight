<H1>Lesson 2</H1>

<P>Hello, and welcome back! In this lesson, we are going to start by doing some adjustments to make your guitar very comfortable and easy to play. Not only will your fingers hurt less, but you will also be encouraged to play more and practice more because you are "playing" and not "working."</P>

<H4>Let's begin with your strings:</H4>

<P><B>STRINGS:</B> Most guitars use .010 or .009 strings. This is fine. Please don't go any higher, as it will really begin to hurt your fingers. If you can afford to do so, switch to .008 strings. Yes, they are thin, but they are very comfortable and will be easy on your fingers. You can't go wrong with Ernie Ball .008s for comfort and speed. For tone, you might have to move up a touch, ok? Acoustic players...hey, whatever feels right for you.</P>

<P><B>NECK:</B> I would like you to lower your strings as low as they will go without "buzzing" when you play them. ("Buzzing" is when the strings are so low that they make a buzzing sound when you strum them.) Again, this will make playing much more comfortable and fun. As you get better and your fingers get tougher, you can raise the strings again. If you are going to lower the strings yourself, please be very,VERY careful..one slip and you can scratch your guitar.</P>

<H4>Here's how to do it:</H4>

<P>Just loosen all of your strings a little bit, one at a time.</P>

<P>Then, lower the strings using the proper tool, usually a tiny allen wrench. Some of you play Gibsons and may have to lower the entire bridge. Again, careful, slow and easy...please.</P>

<P>Then, re-tune your guitar. If one string is too low, repeat the same process until it is just right.</P>

<P><B>Does this sound like a laborious and time-consuming task?</B><BR>
Yep.</P>

<P><B>Does it take a long time and a lot of patience?</B><BR>
Yep.</P>

<P><B>Will my guitar *really* be easier to play and hurt my fingers less?</B><BR>
Yep...that's why it is worth the time and trouble.</P> 

<P>If you want to have a guitar store do this for you, just take it in and say, "I'd like for you to put .008s on my guitar and lower the action to as low as humanly possible." This works.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>(PLEASE NOTE: Lowering your strings may cause problems with intonation, i.e., fine-tuning. Most new players don't even notice this, as they are not aware of such fine adjustments. Fine-tuning, done right, requires a strobe tuner and some other gear that all guitar shops use to set-up guitars. So, if you can afford it, have a guitar shop do the work. If you are short on cash, hold off on doing it yourself until you know exactly how to do it correctly. To explain the entire process would take me about 20 pages, so I can't do it here. So, for now, don't worry about it. But, down the road, it is *great* to pay $20 for a pro to set-up your guitar perfectly. We'll take it as it comes.)</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>LEMON OIL: Your fretboard is made of wood. Wood needs care and the best thing for that is lemon oil. Where do you get it? Well, start by borrowing some from the kitchen..it should be in there with the Pledge and other furniture polishes. If not, you can buy a big bottle at the grocery store in the furniture wax shelf. A BIG bottle is less than $2.00 and it is worth it. Apply the lemon oil to a clean cloth. Now, apply the cloth with the oil on it to the surface of the fretboard. If you use too much, no problem. Just let it set for about 30 minutes and then wipe off the excess. </P>

<P><B>Will your neck be slick and fast?</B><BR>
YOU BET. Is it too slick for ya? Then, just wipe off more.</P>

<P>Soon, it will feel "just right." At least better than it does right now, that's for sure.</P>

<P>Put a little on the back of the neck, too. The object is to remove all obstacles which may prevent you from playing low, fast and easy. That makes learning easier, more fun and less painful....exactly what a visit to the dentist is not.</P>

<P><B>NOTE:</B> The combination of new .008 strings, super-low action and the application of lemon oil has caused some new guitarists to lose mental abilities because they can't believe that their guitar could ever play that much faster and feel so much better so much easier. This is a natural reaction. Remain calm.</P>

<P><B>PICKUPS:</B> Does your guitar have single coil pickups? In that case you need to raise them to a point to where they are about 1/8 to 1/16 of an inch below the strings. If they are raised too close, you might experience some electromagnetic distortion...that is, they sound lousy. If so, lower them until it is gone.</P>

<P>Here is how to raise your pickups: Each pickup has a screw on each side of it. To raise the pickup, find a phillips head screwdriver that fits *perfectly* and fit it into the top of the screw. Now, s l o w l y turn the screw *clockwise*. Yes, normally, when you turn a screw clockwise, it goes down, but in this case, it makes pickups go up. Just take it nice and easy...alternative from one side of the pickup to the other...a tiny bit at a time. You want to be VERY careful. One slip and you can scratch your guitar!! That's why you want to use a screwdriver that fits perfectly.</P>

<P>Is it ok to have the pickup closer to the small strings and a little lower (that is, further away from) the big strings? Yes. Whatever sounds best to you. Believe it or not, your guitar will be more sensitive and about 50% louder. That is great for playing leads or chords. You want to play with feeling and emotion, right? Sensitivity is a very strong form of feeling and emotion. So, make those pickups do their job! Do you have an acoustic with no pickups? No pickups, no problem...but, save this just in case you buy an electric later.</P>

<P><B>What if I have "humbucking" pickups, like on a Gibson?</B><BR>
They, generally, are also adjustable in the same way. But, because they are "humbuckers," they are already about twice as sensitive and twice as loud as a single-coil pickup. So, you are already set. That should cover everyone, so let's move on!</P>

<P><B>What kind of picking technique should I use?</B></P>

<P><B>Do I change grips when playing chords/"solos"?</B></P>

<P><B>What's the most common?</B></P>

<P>OK, one at a time...let's do it!</P>

<P>What I am going to offer up is exaggerated... you will need to fine tune it for your own style, ok?</P>

<P><H3>First, let's learn how to hold a pick:</H3></P>

<P>Hold out your right hand.</P>

<P>Gently curl in your middle, ring and pinky fingers until they almost touch your palm.</P>

<P>Now, looking at your right hand, with the fingers noted above curled, point your thumb and index finger as if you were making your hand look like a gun...thumb up and index finger straight out.</P>

<P>Now, curl in your index finger as though you were pulling the trigger..don't let it touch your palm.</P>

<P>Now, lower your thumb to where it rests upon the top right side of your index finger.</P>

<P>Where your thumb and index finger meet is where you should insert a pick.</P>

<P>If you are new, use a Fender medium...classic shape. It's not a magic pick, but many, many people swear by them. As time passes, you'll find the perfect pick for you.</P>

<P>Now, holding the guitar with your hand right above the strings, the point of the pick should be sticking down from the middle of your thumb.</P>

<P>You should have a tiny bit of thumb flesh behind it. This will allow you more control, the ability to mute and use pinch harmonics.</P>

<P>(Pinch harmonics occur when you pick a string and let a tiny bit of the flesh of your thumb hit the string as well. As a result, the note sounds like it just got played through a wah pedal. The best example of this is Billy Gibbons' solo in the ZZ Top song "La Grange." It takes LOTS of practice and control...so, let's finish the basics first, ok?) </P>

<P>Do not grip the pick tightly....this is a light-touch situation. (That is why guitarists have 10 or 12 picks taped to the mic stand in front of them...loose picks often fly away.)</P>

<P>Don't strum hard, you don't need to. </P>

<P>Now, those are the basics.</P>

<P>From here on out, you will make your own adjustments.</P>

<P>In time, you'll find what is most comfortable for you.</P>

<P>Next topic:</P>
 
<P>What's the secret of playing fast guitar? And, how do I begin to play LEADS?</P>

<P>This is a great question. Is there a "secret"? </P>

<P><B>How do you train yourself to play fast, faster... wow..lightening?</B></P>

<P>Let's begin with the beginning,i.e., pick strokes:</P>

<P><B>Light pick strokes?</B><BR>
Yes, don't grip your pick like you're holding on for dear life. Hold it lightly..even a little loose. Most players do...that's why they have 10 extra picks attached to the mic stand in front of them...those babies will get away from you. Or, throw them at the neighbors glaring through the windows yelling, "Turn it down, it's 4 a.m.!!"</P> 

<P>Next, you have to focus. This is the "mental" side of solos:</P>

<P>Confidence is important. To me, you can build your confidence by having a "signature" lick. A "signature" lick is one hot riff that you have down ice cold. You could play this one riff blindfolded and standing on one leg with your eyes closed. </P>

<P>Nurture it, add flavor to it, expand it....not to forget the option of knowing that you can play it faster and faster and faster, i.e., *speed*.</P>

<P>Next, add new licks and riffs onto it or around it.</P>

<P>Listen to some of your great players. Listen to their leads. Don't they all have at least one lick (or riff, etc.) that they seem to "go back to" or use several times in one song? That's their "signature" lick...the one they've had down cold for 10 years. It's tighter than a duck's butt.</P>

<P>They may go on a flourish of 100 notes, then go back to that one simple lick...maybe for confidence or just for a place to call "home." But, they all have one.</P>

<P>For Buddy Guy, it's a long bend with a finger tremolo at the end.</P>

<P>For SRV, it's 3 long bends followed by the same bend 2 steps up.</P>

<P>For Clapton, it's a flourish that begins on the high E string and works its way to the D string, then back up to the high E. Listen to "Have You Ever Loved a Woman" by Clapton and you'll hear it several times in a row as he is adjusting his volume. </P>

<P>For Albert Collins, it's two notes..but, they are searing notes.</P>

<P>For B.B. King, it's two notes with finger vibrato..we all know them well...they are on almost every track he's cut...and he's been playing for around 50 years.</P>

<P>I guess that I'm saying that it's better to know one lick (or short riff) down cold and then "experiment" and add on to it, rather than not know any and just keep hacking around. This gives you the best of both worlds, at least one solid confident solo, plus room to roam and experiment. This adds confidence. Learning it adds focus. </P>

<P>(Just one last thought..kinda philosophical here: Just because a lick is easy for you to play and sounds simple and basic to you doesn't mean that people who hear it think the same way. I've seen some people's jaws drop when hearing licks that I considered pretty lame. Just because a lick is easy for you to play doesn't mean that other people automatically know that. If it sounds good, does the "degree of difficulty" matter? Do other people really care about how hard (or easy) it was for you to play it? No. The bottom line is "hey, that sounds great." If you're shooting for "degree of difficulty," switch to Olympic diving and shoot for a 9.9. Have fun, right?)</P>

<P>Now, for a comment from me about learning to read music, learning scales, roots and other complicated math-related guitar stuff: I could *very* quickly take the easy way out here and tell you that SRV, Hendrix, Clapton, Freddie King, Albert King, Albert Collins, Lonnie Brooks, Robert Johnson, Buddy Guy and many, many more top players never took the time to learn "music theory" or even learn to read music. I could even tell you that Paul McCartney, when first joining up with John Lennon, didn't even know how to tune a guitar...and, according to those who compile and produce such trivial music history, the story is absolutely true!</P>

<P>But, I am not going to take the easy way out on this one.</P>

<P>The bottom line of what we are doing right here is to get you to a point where you can take off on your own.</P>

<P>Unlike some music teachers, I will not string you out for months making you learn theory or even scales. Such things are important if you want to be able to read music, but they are not necessary to play great guitar. If you don't believe this, please send me a photo of several famous blues and/or rock guitarists who are playing live in concert reading from a page of sheet music with a sheet music holder glued to his (or her) guitar....I rest my case. You don't have to know how to read television frequencies and build a tuner in order to enjoy watching TV. All you really need to know is how to click the number on the remote, right? Same difference.</P>

Yes, most of you know and use TAB already and that's great. It helps you to learn leads and notes. It is also a great introduction to <P>theory and reading. I'm very big on education. It's one of the few things in life that no one can take away from you. So, I am very much in favor of knowing theory, roots, reading, etc. It's just that for our purposes, right now, I'd like to help you learn how to *play*.</P>

<P>I sincerely apologize for getting on a soapbox and preaching, but that's how I feel. Learn to play and have fun first. Then, if you *really* want to get serious and learn various theories and such, fine. That's great. You can even major in it in college! But, please consider having fun first, ok? Does this mean you can't do both at once? No, of course not. Just don't feel like you are missing anything special if you don't study and work at theory. If you have any doubts, just read the list of musicians a few paragraphs above this one, ok?<BR>
No problem.</P> 

<P>Again, I apologize. Now, let's get back to the reason we are all here...playing the guitar! </P>

<P>I know that you are tired of reading, so let's learn something new to play before we sign off for this installment. We discussed the confidence of having a dead cold signature lick, something that will turn heads at the music store or while jamming. </P>

<P>This is a favorite of mine that I use when looking at new guitars as it's short and sweet. Today, we'll steal from SRV...I'm joking...we're not really stealing, as he borrowed the lick from someone else. It's a classic lick. </P>

<P>Why do we use "classic" licks or riffs instead of "new" material? We do it so that we can reach the most people. If we use something very new, many people might not be familiar with it. But, if we use something 10 or so years old, hopefully, most people will know it..the more the better. </P>

<P>This time, we'll be learning the opening lick to "Pride and Joy." This lick is also a signature lick, now, of Jimmie V, SRV's brother, and Johnny Winter. The song, "Pride and Joy," is a blues shuffle...a SRV classic. Even though you probably know the lick when you hear it, try to find it on CD or a friend's CD. This lick, which lasts about 6 seconds, opens the song. If you can hear it on CD first, please try to do so. It really helps. This is classic Texas electric blues, but you can play it on an acoustic and still have fun: </P>

<OL>
<LI><P>Place your left middle finger on the 2nd or 3rd fret of the B string.</P>

<LI><P>Hit the note and while it is still making noise, slide it up to the 5th fret on the same string (the B). Now, it starts to get tricky, but hang in there with me, ok?</P>

<LI><P>A split second before you reach the 5th fret of the B string, pick the small E string, which is open, at the same time, so when you reach the 5th fret of the B string, you are playing both the B string and the open E string at the same time with a single pick stroke. I know that covered a lot of territory in just five lines, so please try it again. You *can* do it and there's a quick reward for your efforts. Were you able to do it? YES!!!</P>

<P>Ok, here's the payoff:</P>

<P>At this point, you are playing Jimmie Vaughn's signature lick. If you have seen him in concert or on Austin City Limits, you'veseen and heard this lick many times.</P>

<LI><P>Continuing on with "Pride and Joy": After the initial "slide up and hit" stroke, you'll strum the two strings, the B string with your middle finger on the 5th fret and the little E string open, about 8 times...all with downward strokes. Play around with it..find a way you like. This will vary as you intend to use it. Again, hearing the CD first helps a lot if you haven't heard it. </P>

<LI><P>Now, to polish it off: After hitting it about 8 times, slide your middle finger from the 5th fret to the 8th fret (still on the B string) and, at the same time, drop your index finger onto the E string at the 7th fret.</P>

<LI><P>Now, hit the two strings together, picking downward, the middle finger on the 8th fret of the B string and the index finger on the 7th fret of the little E string, about 8 times. (This is a Johnny Winter blues lick for songs in the key of E.) So, now you have Jimmie V's signature lick, an SRV signature lick which is also the opening to "Pride and Joy" and a Johnny Winter signature lick, which is also used as a signature lick by Eric Clapton in "Ramblin' On My Mind." That's four signature licks in one!! I told you this would be worth it... And, we have a long way to go...</P>

<LI><P>To finish the "Pride and Joy" intro, repeat steps 1 through 3.</P>

<LI><P>Then, on "Pride and Joy," SRV does a wicked bend, which is a challenge, as it is low on the fretboard and there is less room to "bend." Here's the bend, if you're ready to go for it:</P>
 
<P>Place your middle finger on the 2nd fret of the G string. After striking it and while it is still making noise, push it upward on the fretboard. By "upward," I mean towards the D string, not up to a higher fret. It is a tough and challenging bend. </P>

<P> There are only two ways to bend: upward, toward the next string; or, downward. Bending downward is easier, as you are "pulling" instead of "pushing."</P>

<P> If you have any problems with the theory of "pulling" being easier than "pushing," there's an old joke about it which is out of place here, but here's the idea of the story: You have a 10-foot length of chain on the ground and you are on a hill. Is it easier to "pull" the chain up the hill or "push" it up the hill? The ironic part, as mentioned, is that it is easier to "pull" downward, but *please* try to avoid the temptation. Why? Well, as time passes, you'll do most of your bends on the B and E strings, which are near the edge of the fretboard. If you pull them downward, you'll pull your guitar string off of the fretboard, which sounds terrible. So, it's better not to take a shortcut on this one, ok?</P>

<LI><P>Now, as you know from the CD, the song begins, using a blues shuffle..and, it is in E. (It may not sound like it is in E on your particular version, as SRV used to tune down to a Eb in order to make his strings a touch more easy to bend. That is how he could get those wild Hendrix-style bends...but, on other versions, it is in E.)</P>

<LI><P>The chords are E, A7 and B7 for the song. To get the feel of how it fits into a blues song, play the E chord that you learned last time. Now, you have the basics of a blues tune, complete with a 4-way signature lick. Just add your own personal touch and they'll have to drag you out of the House of Blues!</P>

<P>The lick, by the way, works on both acoustic and electric guitars, clean, semi-clean or dirty. Clapton does it on an acoustic, for example.</P>
</OL>

<P>In LESSON THREE, we'll continue our blues signature licks and learn the rest of our blues song, including the turnaround. I'll see you there!</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Be well and take care! Stay in touch and stay in tune! Keep the Blues alive!</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Sincerely,</P>

<P ID="bold">Jim</P>
