<P><B>Comments: </B><BR>Just had to check to see if you had home pics and you did. Great. Angie told me Sunday that the big day was coming up so I said an extra few for you all today.Pauline keeps me updated each time I see her at work.Kelli made it to Ft McMurray after a 36 hr stop in Winnipeg thanks to the attacks on Sept 11. She is working at a camp called Firebag(decide what you want about that name)!! She calls nightly and I pass on the news. Maybe some day you'll come back to the rock for a visit and I'll have the privlige of meeting you beautiful family.</P>
