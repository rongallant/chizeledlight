	<P>Well here is a page that will let you know who the heck I am. I figured it was about time to let everyone in on the big secret. How should I lay this all out?  Should it be like a story?</P>
	
	<P><B><I>It all started in 1973...</I></B></P>

	<P>Nah! I guess I'll just spit it all out and you try and make sense of it.</P>
	
	<P>I started on computers in 1989 on a 286SX 16mhz.  Right away I took to the graphic end of it and learned how to use Harvard Graphics.</P>
	
	<P>There are times I wished I had wanted to learn programming, mostly when I hear the  huge difference in pay. Grrr... But hey, I love what I do, right?!?</P>
	
	<P>After years of tinkering with computers, I decided to go to school to become a computer technician.  I spent 3 years in <A HREF="http://www.compucollege.ca/">Compucollege</A> and gained much knowledge in both computers and in what I wanted to do with them.</P>
	
	<P>Yipper, I should have taken computer graphics!  I am a graphic artist at heart and I guess will always be.  In 1997, after a few years on the Internet, I founded the company Gallant Web Design, and have been designing graphics and web pages ever since.</P>

	<DD><P>Wow! Things have certainly changed for me since July 13, 1998 when I wrote that.  I am currently enrolled in <A HREF="http://www.mun.ca/">Memorial University of Newfoundland (MUN)</A> doing a <A HREF="http://www.cs.mun.ca/">Computer Science</A> Degree.  You guessed it, I am learning to become a programmer.  Also, I will be doing an area known to be one of the toughest in Computer Science, that is Graphics.</P>

<P>This is becoming like a diary for me.</P>

	<DD><P>Yet again things have changed.  After completing 2 semesters of MUN, I have decided it's not the right path for me at this time.  I mean 5 years and another $50,000 on loans!  Who am I kidding?  So I am open for work once again.  Email me if you would like graphics or web page design at its best by Ron.</P>

	<DD><P>Wow, I hardly know where to start.  I think getting out of school was a good idea (Don't listen to me kids).  After doing some freelancing I received a call.  Someone wanted me to work in Florida doing web design.  Hmmmmm let me think, should I take it?  Well that was March 2000 and I have been in <A HREF="http://www.jacksonville.com/">Jacksonville</A> Florida soaking up the sun ever since.  Life is sweet at times isn't it?</P><BR CLEAR="all">

<P>Way back when, I owned a 1972 Chevy Chevelle.  Since I sold it I regret doing so and own many pieces of Chevelle memorabilia.  This includes a model and a hat both with red Chevelles on them.  Since then I have used Redchevelle as my Internet alias.</P></TD></TR></TABLE></DIV>
