		<td><p>Well here she is, Mommy. Better known to the world as Margie.  She has to do all the work when it comes to carrying the baby and going threw all the different stages that come along with it. So far she is pretty impressive. You would think she does this all the time.  She even takes care of me and Ariana.  Guess thats why I love her soo much.</p></td>
