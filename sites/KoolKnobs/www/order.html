<h3>How do I get one?</h3>
<p>I'll need 
						                    some information about your vehicle and the Koolknobs brand 
						                    product you'd like to have made:</p>
<h4>1) What  color would you like for the background?</h4>
              <p>You can choose from red, blue, black, bone, yellow, orange, green, 
                grey, and pearled clear. I can swirl them together for you (two 
                colors) if you like. Or, you can send me a small liquid sample 
                of your paint for a knob color matched to your vehicle! There's 
                no extra charge for the color matching.</p>
<h4>2) 
						                    I need to know the thread size of your shift lever.</h4>
              <p>Just take your old knob to a hardware store, find a bolt it fits 
                correctly, and note the thread size (no need to buy the bolt). 
                It'll be something like 3/8-24 or M10 X 1.5. I can take it from 
                there. You can also email me with the year and make of your vehicle. 
                I keep track of the various vehicles, so I may already have that 
                info.</p>
              <p>Some vehicles don't have a threaded shift lever (you Ford truck owners know 
                what I'm talking about here!), but that won't stop us! I'll just 
                need a diameter of the lever (taken with an accurate tool like 
                a caliper) and the length of the ribbed part of the shift lever. 
                Again, if you have questions, email me. I've been keeping track 
                of those, too.</p>
              <p>Recently completed: an adapter for the popular Lokar brand shifters. 
                It takes some extra work to make, so its adapter will have an 
                extra charge of $10. I've got the necessary measurements, so be 
                sure to let me know it's for a Lokar shift lever, and I'll accomodate 
                your needs.</p>
<p>If 
						                    you have a column shift, I'll need similar information about 
						                    the ribbed part of the shift lever so I can make you a sleeve 
						                    that fits over your old knob's location.</p>
<h4>3) 
						                    What shape would you like?</h4>
				</div>
				<div align="left">
					
              <ul>
                <li>2-1/4&quot; Round (about the size of a pool ball)</li>
                <li>2&quot; Round (very popular size, probably what you have now)</li>
                <li>1-7/8&quot; Round (small, like the old muscle car knobs from 
                  the 60's)</li>
                <li>Small Taper (most people use this on a column shift)</li>
                <li>Teardrop (you'd use this on a column shift)</li>
                <li>Tall Oval (similar to the teardrop, for column shifters)</li>
                <li>2&quot; Flared Top (check out the photos page for the shape)</li>
                <li>2&quot; Oval (Old timey flavor to this one)</li>
                <li>New, a Tall Taper similar to the ones found on the big rigs.</li>
                <li>Be sure to check out the Column Tapers on the second sample 
                  page. </li>
                <li>Other custom shapes available for added charge.</li>
              </ul>

<h4>4) 
						                    How much will it cost?</h4>
              <p>Prices are as follows; add $6 to cover shipping. By the way, 
                if you order two knobs, I only charge you one $7 shipping charge!:)</p>
              <p>If I put something in it for you, it's $25 a knob.</p>
              <p>The Skull and Smiley knobs are $30 because I make my own parts 
                for these.</p>
              <p>If you want a swirl pattern, it's $20 (easier to make).</p>
              <p>The new-to-the-line dash knobs are $12.50 each. (they take about 
                the same time to make as the full size shifter knob!)</p>
              <p>Optional brushed aluminum jam nut, $10. (these aren't always 
                needed, so ask about this option)</p>
              <p>Optional polished jam nut, $15.</p>
              <p>Lokar fit, $10.</p>
              <p>Included in these prices will be the necessary adapter to fit 
                your vehicle. I make some little extras, too, like special adapters 
                that take extra time to make. Ask about prices, because it depends 
                on how much time they take to make. You can get knobs cheaper 
                than these, but you'll end up with &quot;universal&quot; fit, 
                which usually doesn't. You'll also love the &quot;feel&quot; of 
                these, smooth and comfortable in all seasons and temps. I'm currently 
                not making anything with electronic or mechanical buttons in the 
                adapter, except for the Lokar adapter mentioned above.</p>

<p>Column 
										                                  Shifters</p>
              <p>For column shifters (usually a splined shaft), a brushed aluminum 
                adapter is included. Add $5.00 for polished finish. This adapter 
                should be glued on with a good epoxy, like JB Weld. It won't vibrate 
                or come loose. I can do set screws if you want, but they wouldn't 
                be my first choice. For most of the column knobs, the adapter 
                is done so that it replaces your stock knob; it won't show at 
                all in most cases.</p>
<h4>5) 
						                    How do I pay for this?</h4>
              <p>You can use your Paypal account to pay for your shifter knob, 
                or I also accept personal checks or money orders (payable to Bruce 
                Roosa) when you place your order.</p>
<h4>6) 
						                    When will I get the product?</h4>
<p>It usually 
						                    takes about 3 days to make the product once I have your order. 
						                    Another 3 or 4 for the Post Office to do its thing, and you've 
						                    got a Koolknobs brand product on your vehicle. But just in 
						                    case I'm backed up on orders, give me two weeks before you 
						                    get to wondering about where your money went!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>7)
