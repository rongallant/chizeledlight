<H4><A NAME="1">What is the Pickyourbrainetc Network?</A>
<A HREF="#top_faq"><IMG SRC="graphics/nav_top.gif" WIDTH=12 HEIGHT=6 ALT="TOP" BORDER="0"></A>
</H4>

The Pickyourbrainetc Network is the fastest growing group of talented artists across
the nation and abroad. We are united for the common good of the individual artist in
order to better sell, maintain and expose artists and their work for all to see.<P>




<H4><A NAME="2">How do we plan to accomplish this goal?</A>
<A HREF="#top_faq"><IMG SRC="graphics/nav_top.gif" WIDTH=12 HEIGHT=6 ALT="TOP" BORDER="0"></A></H4>

The Pickyourbrainetc Network has the best exposure strategy for artists around - we are
taking no chances on becoming the success story you want to be a part of. We have
comprised a 15 member panel who looks at every potential applicant that comes to the
network.Fifteen of your peers,artists from every genre will look, critique and then
judge new membership. We do this because there are a vast amount of people in this world
who consider themselves artists but unfortunately are not. In addition, we are currently
compiling a catalogue with all of our artists so that we don&#146;t have to sell over the
Internet. We know that there is no way to show absolutely everyone that comes to us on the
Internet, but we intend to show each and everyone of our artists on our catalogue. Our
Internet site(s) are being put together by some of the most talented freelance web artists
we could find, and unlike other companies who just stick their logo on the web site and
call it a day, you ( meaning any of you ) who contribute to making the site the best it
can be, will be fully credited for your work.<P>

Our catalogues are fun to look at, they show you and who you are at your best, there
isn&#146;t a person around who won&#146;t look at them and say -wow this guy is good,
even if they don&#146;t decide to purchase from us.<P>

And finally - the all important salesperson, those people who go out there and tell
people about you, show them the catalogue and direct them to the site containing your
work. These are our three methods of how we are going to make you a resounding success,..
in a nutshell.<P>




<H4><A NAME="3">What Type of art are we looking for?</A>
<A HREF="#top_faq"><IMG SRC="graphics/nav_top.gif" WIDTH=12 HEIGHT=6 ALT="TOP" BORDER="0"></A></H4>

What we are looking for is marketable art, we currently have people from all different
genres, from Oil or watercolor paintings, to quilting and digital artists. We range,
don&#146;t exclude yourself from the possibilities there is a place for most everyone. We
look at all works and look at each with a different perspective, we have seen people say
they aren&#146;t good enough - let us decide for you whether or not it will sell.<P>



<H4><A NAME="4">Are we imposing an age limitation?</A>
<A HREF="#top_faq"><IMG SRC="graphics/nav_top.gif" WIDTH=12 HEIGHT=6 ALT="TOP" BORDER="0"></A></H4>

I would say no, however, there are certain things we look for in especially young
people. People who are 16-18 must realize this is a business designed on contract work,
if they cannot provide the time and energy it takes to complete any given task, they
shall be removed from the network. We don&#146;t mean to say that all people within this
age group have not lived up to this expectation, but in a business focused on time and
quality of art we cannot rely on those people who cannot perform when necessary. For
people of other age, ethnicity, background, etc. It doesn&#146;t matter, we only ask
that you derive from your personal experience how long it takes you to do a piece and how
much you will regularly charge.<P>



<H4><A NAME="5">How do we stay in contact?</A>
<A HREF="#top_faq"><IMG SRC="graphics/nav_top.gif" WIDTH=12 HEIGHT=6 ALT="TOP" BORDER="0"></A></H4>

You don&#146;t want to make long distance phone calls you say? well that is not
necessary, ICQ is one of the most powerful free tools we have at our disposal on a daily
basis, especially good for the transferring of files as most ICQ users know. In addition
this is where more than half of the network resides and how they were found to become a
part of this company. Messaging myself ( Tony Mendez AKA. The brainman ICQ# 45466770 ) will
always get you a response back, and relatively quickly most times, in addition the
network is an excellent opportunity to meet, talk to, and learn from artists pertaining
to your background and style. Always room to grow in the network.<P>



<H4><A NAME="6">What does it cost you to get into this network?</A>
<A HREF="#top_faq"><IMG SRC="graphics/nav_top.gif" WIDTH=12 HEIGHT=6 ALT="TOP" BORDER="0"></A></H4>

It costs you nothing to get into this network. This is a scam you are thinking - a
scam to take my art away and sell it and leave me in the cold, I get that response a lot, people can&#146;t believe in a company that doesn&#146;t want to take their money right
from the start.Selling your art is how we turn a profit, if you are more interested read
the information packet provided on this site and you will see what each of the Network
artists receives every month, you will also see what it is we do, and the changes we
implement and how they effect you. I myself am an artists, a cartoonist by nature and
have done various works, you may not have seen them, you might have, I am more than
willing to share my experiences with you.<P>




<H4><A NAME="7">How do we pay for your promotion?</A>
<A HREF="#top_faq"><IMG SRC="graphics/nav_top.gif" WIDTH=12 HEIGHT=6 ALT="TOP" BORDER="0"></A></H4>

Salespeople who sell your work, work on commission. The catalogue will feature only
those companies which cater to art as far as advertisements, making it both good for the
advertiser and good for the network to find what is we are looking for. How do we pay for
the Internet site? The plan is to get free sites for the time being, so no one has to
pay for anything, you will see the professional look of them all together when we are
finished with the construction of these sites. Why else should we charge you? To make
money for our pockets? The reality is, not many people can make it in this world as a
solo artist, and those that do, well.. they don&#146;t have much money to spend on the
hopes that they would get sold, otherwise they would contact an agent, we at the
Pickyourbrainetc Network know that by uniting us a whole, even if someone comes to the
sites to see another artist, they may come across your work, and what&#146;s that really
worth to you?<P>



<H4><A NAME="8">What do we need from you?</A>
<A HREF="#top_faq"><IMG SRC="graphics/nav_top.gif" WIDTH=12 HEIGHT=6 ALT="TOP" BORDER="0"></A></H4>

We haven&#146;t asked for much, but we will ask for two things. We need you artists
Bio., and in that Bio. We will need to have information about you, and who you are, we
also need your FULL NAME and SCREEN NAME where applicable, an e-mail address where we can
send you pertinent information regarding the network and if you have it.. we need to have
a pricing schedule as to what you charge for what you provide and if you are doing
business as your name or other. If you like it would be helpful for you to tell us what
other work you have done for money, and with whom ( past business, happy past clients )<P>

The other of the two and most importantly your samples. We understand that some of you
do not have a scanner or means at your immediate disposal to get your work scanned, if you
are interested and that is the case, you must send us an e-mail to <A HREF="mailto:tmendez@poweredbyart.com">tmendez@poweredbyart.com</A>
telling us when you can have us that material, at that point your information will be
stored in a section with others to be contacted later, if you don&#146;t contact us by
your predetermined time frame, we will not contact you, and your file will be deleted.<P>

For those of you who do have the requested samples and Bio. On hand we ask that you
send them to the same e-mail address in jpeg format in a zip file. We cannot use large
files, there are a vast amount of people trying to get into the network, we have limited
space on the web and computers, the smaller the file ( without jeopardizing the content )
the better.<P>
