<H3>What does Kokoro Budokai mean?</H3>

The Kokoro Budokai is a place where the spirit, ethics and skills of the martial arts are practiced.  We do not train athletes just to win, but rather we train citizens in sportsmanship to have convictions, and the ethical and moral values to make one a success in their lives.  We do this by word and example. <P>

The Kokoro Budokai is made up of two words that can be broken down thus:<P>
<UL>
<LI><H3>Kokoro</H3>
The word kokoro means the heart, spirit and soul of a person.  Kokoro represents the essence of a person.  It is said that in any martial art, the student will not succeed unless s/he is filled with kokoro.<P>

A person with kokoro does not look for what benefit a deed will do for them, but rather how it will benefit others. <P> 

A judoka (judo player) who competes well, but does not win should not feel bad, but s/he should look at what has been learned from the experience. In other words, you compete not to win the prize, but to conquer oneself. It is the inner victory that is all-important, and not the external one.  Such a person is said to have kokoro.<P>

<LI><H3>Budo</H3>
Budo is concerned with the physical and spiritual training offered through the study and practice of the martial arts. <P>

<LI><H3>Budokai</H3>
Budokai or Budokwai means the Way of Knighthood in Society.  The Budokai is the oldest Judo club in Europe.  The original Budokai was a place where all the martial arts could be practiced.  The original Budokai in London was founded by Koizumi Gunji in 1918, one of the first jujutsu and judo masters in all of Europe.  The original Budokai was based on the principle of amateur sport, and the democratic control of the dojo by its members.  The kokoro Budokai has the same principle.<P>
