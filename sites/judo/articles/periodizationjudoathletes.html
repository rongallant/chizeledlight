By: Tom Gallant, M. Ed., 4th Dan<BR>
NCCP: Master Course Conductor for Judo</DIV>

<H3>Introduction</H3>Ever since sport began, athletes and coaches have been trying to get the most from their training.&nbsp; All athletes, including judo players (judoka) want to get their best performance in the shortest time possible and at the right time.&nbsp; In other words they want their best performance at the highest level of competition they will compete in for that year.&nbsp; To achieve these results, athletes and coaches have to modify their training programs in such a way as to peak athletes at the appropriate time in their program so they will evoke an optimal performance. The method of attaining these performance-enhancing results is achieved through periodization, or dividing an athletic training program into phases.<P>

<H3>Rationale</H3>This paper was written to fulfill the needs, as I see them, regarding the training and planning of athletes that will represent the province in national competition, e.g. Canada Winter Games.&nbsp; The coach responsible for the training of athletes is the Level two certified coach, who must be able to take the plans set out by the provincial coach, interpret them and put them into practice.&nbsp; Because the athletes are spread across the province, this is a necessity.&nbsp; As a result, the Level two coach must be able to read, interpret and follow a yearly plan for his/her athletes.&nbsp; This paper was written to fill the gap between what is presently taught as part of the Level two programs and what is taught at level three.&nbsp; For the most part, the material contained in this paper does not duplicate what is taught in Level three, but tries to bridge the gap between the two levels.<P>

<H3>Methodology</H3>

There are many models of yearly
planning that are in use in the sport community.&nbsp; The most widely used model for periodizing or planning athletic
training is the Bompa model.&nbsp; Bompa's
model is best described in the book: Bompa, T. (1994). Theory and Methodology of Training: The key to athletic performance,
3rd Edition, Iowa: Kendall/Hunt Publishing Company., and Bompa, T.
(1993). Periodization of Strength: The
new wave in strength training, Don Mills, Ontario: Veritas Publishing
Company.&nbsp; The Bompa Model is the one the
author has chosen to use for this article.<P>

<H3>Training</H3>

Training can be defined as "an
exercise program to develop an athlete for a particular event.&nbsp; Increasing skill of performance and energy
capabilities are of equal consideration" (Bompa, 1994, p. 159).&nbsp; To achieve the desired effect from training,
the athlete must take into consideration certain stimuli such as physiological,
psychological, biochemical (nutrition), social, and technical.&nbsp; All this information comes from the athlete,
and the results obtained can only be as good as the information obtained.&nbsp; Consequently, the coach, who will build the
training process, may not be in the best position to evaluate the training
effects of the plan.<P>

<H3>Periodization</H3>

Bompa (1994) defined periodization
as "a process of structuring training into [periods and] phases," p.
375.&nbsp; In order to show the breakdown of
the components of training, the coach must first understand how these periods
and phases reflect the life cycle of an athlete (See Figure 1).&nbsp; The author has estimated that the average
competitive life cycle of an athlete between 12 and 16 competitive years.&nbsp; This life cycle is further sub-divided into
quadrennials, or four-year plans, which coincide with the time-span between Olympic
games.&nbsp; Each quadrennial is sub-divided
into yearly plans or periods called yearly planning instruments (YPI's).&nbsp; The process of building a period of training
is called periodization.<P>

<H4>Figure 1 - Athlete Life Cycle</H4>

<H3>Periods and Cycles</H3>

A period consists of a three phases working together in a block or group.&nbsp; Periods include a preparatory phase, a competitive phase, and a transition phase. When these three phases occur once within a 12-month time span, we have a monocycle.&nbsp; If a period occurs twice in a 12-month time span, this is referred to as a bicycle. When a period occurs three times within a 12-month time span, this is referred to as a tricycle. If a period repeats itself more than three times, we have a multi-cycle (See Figure 2).<P>

<H4>Figure 2 - Cycles of Training</H4>

<DIV ALIGN="center"><IMG alt="" border=0 height=163 src="periodizationjudoathletes_files/image004.gif" width=515></DIV><P>

The easiest way for a coach to choose the best cycle to use (a monocycle, a bicycle, a tricycle or a multi-cycle) is to count the number of main competitions in the year. If the athlete will attend only one major competition in a 12-month period, then use a monocycle.&nbsp; If there are two main competitions in a 12-month span, then use a bicycle, E.g. a main competition in November, such as the Ontario Open Championships and one in May, such as the Senior Nationals.&nbsp; It will be extremely rare for any developing athlete to use a tricycle or a multi-cycle in their training plan.&nbsp; Most high performance coaches do not use these.<P>

<H3>Phases</H3>Each period has three phases of training: the preparatory phase, the competitive phase and the transition phase (See Figure 3).&nbsp; The three phases are further subdivided into sub phases.<P>

Note.&nbsp; The planning instrument used to chart a yearly plan is the YPI (Yearly Planning Instrument).<P>

<H2>Putting the Period into practice</H2>

<H3>Performance Factors</H3>

When you plan to train your athlete, what you are in effect trying to do is take all the components of training, called performance factors, and systematically brings them to a point where the athlete is "peaked" for the competition.&nbsp; These performance factors are divided into:<P>

<UL>
	<LI>Technical
	<LI>Strategies/Tactics
	<LI>Mental
	<LI>Physical
</UL>

<H4>Each performance factor is broken down into various components, e.g.:</H4>

<UL>
	<LI>Technical
<UL>
	<LI>The various judo techniques or waza, which the athlete does best, e.g.
<UL>
	<LI>O soto gari or harai goshi
	<LI>Kenka youtsu grip
	<LI>Special entries to techniques   
</UL>
</UL> 
</UL>
	
<UL>
	<LI>Strategies/Tactics
<UL>
	<LI>The drills and simulations your athlete will use in the competition.
<UL>
	<LI>Combination and counters
	<LI>Set-up's and fakes  
</UL>
	<LI>Fighting for grip (power hand versus control 
          hand)       

</UL> 
</UL>

	
<UL>
	<LI>Mental
<UL>
	<LI>Relaxation
<LI>Activation
<LI>Visualization
<LI>Environmental control
<LI>Assessment&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</UL> 
</UL>

<UL>
	<LI>Physical
	<UL>
		<LI>Aerobic conditioning
		<LI>Anaerobic training
		<LI>Speed training
		<LI>Strength training
		<LI>Power training
		<LI>Flexibility training
		<LI>Nutrition training 
	</UL> 
</UL>

<H2>What to do</H2>

Take all the various performance factors and their components and apply the general guidelines set out in the three phases and sub-phases below.<P> 

<H3>General Preparatory Phase (See Figure 3, A)</H3>

The training needed at this stage include the following:<P> 

<UL>
<LI>Get the athletes in shape generally, use any method you wish.&nbsp; The training does not have to be judo activities.&nbsp; Use what works best.
	<UL>
	<LI>Lots of aerobic activity. E.g., there is a 
          great deal of work, but the intensity is low;                
	</UL>&nbsp;
<LI>Training skills are introduced, e.g.:
	<UL>
	<LI>Goal setting, 
	<LI>Teach the various mental skills, such as:
		<UL>
		<LI>Relaxation Training
		<LI>Energization Training
		<LI>Positive Self-Talk
		<LI>Visualization Training
		<LI>Concentration Training 
		</UL>
	<LI>Nutrition training and planning,    
	</UL>
<LI>Develop general strength training.   
</UL>&nbsp;


<H4>Note: use lots of reps. Train aerobically.</H4>

<H3>Specific Preparatory Phase (See Figure 3, B)</H3>

The training needed at this stage include the following:

<UL>
	<LI>Everything in the general preparatory phase is now focussed on judo.&nbsp; E.g. use judo related activities, such as newaza randori for longer than 2 minutes. Each week the length of each randori will increase.
	<LI>The training loads are increased, in other words, the workloads get harder, but you are still training your athlete aerobically.
	<LI>The activities are more structured than they 
        were in the general preparatory phase.             
</UL>


<H3>Pre-competitive Phase (See Figure 3, C)</H3>



The training needed at this stage include the following:



<UL>
	<LI>This phase lasts about 4 - 6 weeks.
	<LI>The aerobic energy systems was trained in the specific preparatory
	<LI>The anaerobic alactic system, and the anaerobic lactic system will be trained in this phase.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		<UL>
		<LI>The intensity of the workouts is high.
		<LI>The frequency of high intensity workouts 
          increases in number.&nbsp; Note: follow high intensity workout days 
          with low intensity days (See Figure 6 below).                      
		</UL>
	<LI>The training should be done in drills, simulating actual competition situations:
		<UL>
		<LI>When performing anaerobic lactic drills have 
          the athlete work between 10 seconds and under 2 minutes.&nbsp; Each 
          week the training should get harder or more intense. E.g. say 70% of 
          full intensity one week, then at 75% intensity the next week.                                        
		</UL>
	<LI>Introduce your athlete to competitions. Do not look at the results as anything more than a part of the training (winning is not what is the most important).&nbsp;Use them to see if the techniques used are working.
	<LI>The coach should adjust the training to accommodate the athlete.         
</UL>

<H3>Competitive Phase (See Figure 3, D)</H3>

The training needed at this stage include the following:

<UL>
	<LI>Competitions are the main focus of this phase.
	<LI>This is the phase in which you test your training program.
	<LI>Test the stress levels of your athlete in competition situations.
	<LI>Maintain all fitness levels.
	<LI>Emphasize technical and tactical work.
	<LI>Volume of activity is decreased (See Figure 3, E).
	<LI>The intensity of drills and simulations are 
        high.&nbsp; E.g. try to simulate the competition.             
</UL>

<UL>
	<LI><B>Definitions:</B>
	<UL>
		<LI>Volume is the amount of activity to do, more often called capacity. 
		<LI>Intensity is how hard you work doing the 
          activity, more often called power.            
	</UL>
</UL>

<H3>Competitive Sub-phases</H3> 

This phase is divided into three sub phases:

<UL>
	<LI>Unloading or tapering 
	<LI>Special Preparatory phase
	<LI>Main competition 
</UL>

<H3>1. Unloading (tapering)</H3>

<UL>
	<LI>This period lasts about 10 days to three weeks. 
	<LI>Reduce training sessions to 2 times per week.
	<LI>This goes just before you want to "peak" an athlete.&nbsp; There could be 2 - 3 peaks in the competitive phase.&nbsp; The first is not usually the main one.
	<LI>When key competitions occur, the coach should reduce the workload.

	<UL>
		<LI>Reduce the number of practices,
		<LI>Reduce the training volume.
		<LI>E.g. (See Figure 4).	   
	</UL>
</UL>

<H4>Figure 4 - Unloading Intensity Chart</H4>

<DIV ALIGN="center"><IMG alt="" border=0 height=213 src="periodizationjudoathletes_files/unloadingintensity.gif" width=585></DIV><P>

<UL>
	<LI>Increase mental training drills and simulations
	<LI>Reduce weight training to 2 times per week.       
</UL>

<H3>2. Special Preparation Period (See Figure 3, F)</H3>

This refers to specific training plans the coach may have just prior to an event.&nbsp; This is usually special psychological training the coach has made to aid the athlete prepare for the competition.&nbsp; This could include the following:

<UL>
	<LI>Special meals the day before the event,
	<LI>A visit to the competition area the evening before the event.
	<LI>Relaxation plans the coach has made for the athlete in the days/hours prior to the event.               
</UL>



<H3>Competition (See Figure 3, G)</H3>

This section deals with the activities on the days of the competition.&nbsp; These include but are not limited to:


<UL>
	<LI>Mental preparation (activation and relaxation),
	<LI>Pre-competition meals,
	<LI>Hydration (get your athlete to drink as much as 
        they need),          
</UL>

<H3>Transition: Off -Season and Cross Training (See Figure 3, H)</H3>



This phase in the YPI is considered a time away from judo, but not away from total training.&nbsp; It is sometimes referred to as cross training.&nbsp; This training phase is marked by the following characteristics:

<UL>
	<LI>Training intensities are lowered to about 40 - 50% of competition training loads. 
	<LI>It normally lasts about 3 - 4 weeks long. 
	<LI>Activities should be different from those used throughout the period.
	<LI>Analyze past periods in preparation for the next. 
	<LI>Plan the next training period, with its phases 
        and sub-phases.         
</UL>

<H3>Macrocycles and Microcycles</H3>

Macrocycles and microcycles are commonly used when training phases are broken down into smaller planning units (See Figure 5, below).<P>

<H4>Figure 5 - Sub divisions of Training</H4>

<DIV ALIGN="center"><IMG alt="" border=0 height=287 src="periodizationjudoathletes_files/image010.gif" width=496></DIV><P>

<H3>Macrocycles</H3>Macrocycles are used to organize large training units or training objectives.&nbsp; Macrocycles breakdown sub-phases such as general preparatory, specific preparatory, pre-competitive, and main competitive into manageable training units.<P>

The duration of a macrocycle depends on the phase and sub-phase it is part of and the training goals the coach has set for it.&nbsp; E.g. in the preparatory phase, macrocycles can last between four (4) and Six (6) weeks or four (4) to six (6) micro cycles (Bompa, 1994, p.159).&nbsp; In the competitive phase macrocycles can be as short as, two (2) weeks or as long as four (4) weeks.<P>

Some examples of macrocycles are:<P>

</TABLE><P>

<H3>Microcycles</H3>

Microcycles are short training periods designed to maximize the benefits of each workout. Microcycles are weekly training programs. They are subdivisions of macrocycles.&nbsp; E.g. If a macrocycle is of a six (6) week duration, then there are six (6) microcycles in the macrocycle.<P>

At the microcycle stage, the coach should carefully monitor the athlete for signs of fatigue, and should adjust the volume and intensity of each workout accordingly (See Figure 6, below).<P>

<H4>Figure 6 - The Volume and Intensity of a Microcycle</H4>

<DIV ALIGN="center"><IMG SRC="periodizationjudoathletes_files/microcycletraining.gif" WIDTH=585 HEIGHT=224 ALT="" BORDER="0"></DIV><P>

Each microcycle is sub-divided into training sessions or training days.&nbsp; These training sessions have to be planned with the microcycle or week in mind.<P>

<H3>Mesocycle</H3>

A mesocycle is a relatively new term used by some authors to represent a planning unit that falls between the macrocycle and the microcycle. When the mesocycle is used with planning, the macrocycle takes on a different meaning than what we are using in this paper.&nbsp; The Bompa method of planning does not use this term, and it appears to be going out of fashion.<P>
