<FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,arial">The art of Kodokan Judo was derived from the bujutsu (ancient martial or warlike) arts of
feudal Japan.  Predominant among these arts was that of jujitsu.  The founder of Kodokan
Judo (judo for short) was Dr. Jigoro Kano, a Rhodes Scholar, and a noted educator in Japan,
who took the art of judo and used his influence to establish it as the basis for a
revitalized physical education program in Japanese schools.  This start was the
instrument that put judo on the world stage and later into the Olympic Games.  Today,
the sport and art of judo is practiced in over 92 countries throughout the world.<P>

Since Jujutsu schools were in a state of disrepute by the members of Japanese society
for being too violent, many of the jujutsu schools came together. Kano's judo was an
amalgamation of some of the more popular jujutsu school's of Japan.  Prominent among
these were the Tenshin Shinyo Ryu and the Kito Ryu schools.  When asked why the term
judo was used instead of jujutsu, Kano replied &quot;what I teach is not simply jujutsu.&nbsp;
Of course I teach jujutsu, but it is upon 'do' (way or principle).&quot;  In addition to
encompassing the best of many jujutsu arts, Kano's judo also reflected a broader
range of techniques.<P>

Judo still encompasses the five elements of defense as used in old jujutsu: throwing,
grappling, joint locks, strangulation and striking (striking is only practiced in kata
or formal forms, and not in competition).  The old methods have been refined and modified
to take in sport as well as methods of fighting which reflect modern society.&nbsp; In 1964,
judo was officially accepted as a sport in the modern Olympics, and has participated in
every Olympics since.</FONT><P>
