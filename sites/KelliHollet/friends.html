<P><H2>My Friends</H2>

This page is dedicated to all of my friends who have been
there for me through all of my ups and downs..thanks guys.

<P><H3><A HREF="http://www.ucs.mun.ca/~v73amg/">Angie</A></H3>
I have known this chick since like FOREVER...She has put
up with everything I dish out..and believe me it has been 
a lot...but I guess that is what friends are for. Through 
thick and thin...she has been there. I guess you could say 
she has been my shrink since my younger years. Currently 
she is a student of Memorial University in St.Johns,
Newfoundland. You go girl! 

<P><H3><A HREF="http://welcome.to/ronsplace">Ron</A></H3>
Ron is Angies brother..so I have known him for a while 
too...but he used to torture me!...I guess that is what
big brothers do...torture their little sisters and 
their friends! He has changed a lot since then...actually 
if it wasn't for him...I would not have this web
page...so thanks Ron. 

<P><H3>Tobi & Jamie</H3>
These two are the best...they certainly make my life 
intersting...And the cutest couple ever! Both are
attending college here in Stephenville and if I
had to make a guess...I would say they will be 
together forever. 
Tobi is a also another one of my shrinks...she
gives advice that I don't always take...but
eventually I samarten up and realize she 
is right...I know Tobi...you told me so...

<P><H3>Bride & Danny</H3>
I met Bride like two years ago and we have 
been pals ever since...she is great at putting
up with my constant complaining. Originally 
from Ontario...she now lives in Stephenville...wrong
choice Bride...but I think you know that.*L*
She is the proud mother of a great 12 year 
old Danny...he is the cutest kid...and very sweet

<P><H3><A HREF="http://www.angelfire.com/ca2/bigdog">John (a.k.a JJ)</A></H3>
JJ was like the first person that I met on the net
and we have been talking ever since. He lives in 
Califoria...God don't I wish I lived there! Some
people don't realize how lucky they are!...He is 
online almost as much as me...another inernet 
junky...He is a great guy and a very good friend.


<P><H3><A HREF="http://web.psych.ualberta.ca/~jono/rowdy.html">Jono (a.k.a Domitan)</A></H3>
An ICQ buddie of mine...and a great guy!...This guy 
has lived everywhere...no exageration!  Edmonton 
Albetra is his latest residence.*L*  One of the
most mentally together people I have met on 
the net...Truly someone to be admired.

<P><H3>Andre</H3>
Last but not least is Andre Maurice Suthers...the 
greatest guy ever...and sexy too! Don't get any ideas 
girls...he is mine! Andre lives in Michigan, 
Detroit...he is a proud worker of KFC*L* and
will soon be graduating from college with a 
degree in Graphic Design..his life goal is 
to work for Crysler and design Dodge Vehicles...you
go guy! Oh...I almost forgot...he is the all
time expert of a certain mystery meat a.k.a SPAM.
