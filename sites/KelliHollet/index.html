<P><H2>Welcome</H2>
<IMG SRC="./graphics/kelli1.gif" WIDTH=137 HEIGHT=133 ALT="Kelli" BORDER="0" ALIGN="RIGHT">

<P>Hello and welcome to my world...I hope you enjoy my page and feel free to visit often *S*
I have included links to my friends pages and also my favorite places to hang on the net. 

<H3>All About Me...</H3>

<P>Well...here is some general info about me for those of you who would like to know...

<P>I was born May 24, 1977...which makes me 21...in the province of British
Columbia...but moved to Stephenville, Newfoundland at a young age...and
have lived here ever since. I am currently working as a cashier at a
local store...but not for long! I plan on attending University this
fall in Halifax, Nova Scotia where I hope to eventually graduate with
a degree in Clinical Social Work.

<H3>Hobbies/Interests...</H3>

<P>I guess I am pretty much like anyone else, I love music, movies and a little
TV...but my #1 hobbie has to be the net. I can be found online quite 
frequently...I really enjoy talking to my friends through ICQ and in 
<A HREF="http://www.webmaster@chathouse.com">www.webmaster@chathouse.com</A>.
I love to meet  people from all over the world...oh and online I am known as Blue Eyes.

<P>I am not really talented when it comes to most sports...but I love to
watch them especially curling! I know what you are thinking...totally 
boring...but I love it! I guess not everyone can be football fans...I
do enjoy actually participating in some sports though...like skiing 
and skating...you know...the winter ones...maybe that comes from my 
background...Newfoundland can have some pretty white and cold winters.

<P>When it comes to music I get a little confusing...I like just about 
anything from Mariah...to Matchbox 20...My CD collection consists 
of Rap, Hip Hop, Alternative, Dance...and Pop.
I think I am just a total music lover in general...I even have a 
lot of the oldies...like the Eagles...and Boston...they ROCK!
However...the ones usually in my CD player are Matchbox 20, 
Brian McKnight, Goo Goo Dolls, or Mariah.

<P>Movies are another big interest for me...I am into all different
kinds but my all time favorites are "The Basketball Diaries" 
"Can't Hardly Wait" "Friday" and "Set it off"...basically anthing 
that can keep my attention is on my list, and I have to say that 
Leonardo DiCaprio is a terrific actor...and not bad looking either.

<P>I think Television is highly over rated...The only shows I enjoy 
are "Party of Five" "Friends" and "Dawsons Creek" But I think
people watch way to much tv...there is so much more to life.
