The Thylacine is a marsupial - an animal that raises its young in a pouch.&nbsp;
One characteristic, which differentiates Thylacines from other marsupials
such as opossums and kangaroos, is that a Thylacine's pouch opens backwards,
giving its young more protection when moving through the bush.</FONT>

Thylacines bred once a year, most likely in December.&nbsp; The female
gives birth to approximately four young that are not yet developed.&nbsp;
These tiny babies crept unaided through the mother's belly fur to reach
and cling to a nipple inside her pouch, where they lived until they were
completely developed.&nbsp; By July or August, the young were too big
for the pouch and were left in a sheltered place, such as a small lair
in a rocky den or under a rotting tree, while the mother hunted for
food.&nbsp; Later, the young followed the mother while she hunted.&nbsp;
The litter stayed close to the nest or their mother until they were able
to hunt for themselves.</FONT></TD><TD><IMG SRC="mother.gif" WIDTH=179
