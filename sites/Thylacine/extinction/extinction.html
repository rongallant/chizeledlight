<FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#999900"><B>2000 years ago…</B></FONT><P>

The story of the Thylacine is a sad one.&nbsp;  Many things contributed
to their demise.&nbsp; We do know that it used to be widespread in New
Guinea about 7,000 years ago and has probably been extinct there for
2,000 years.&nbsp;  This has been attributed to wild dogs which
competed for the same niche.<P>

Before the Aborigines arrived in Australia about 7,000 years ago,
the Thylacine was at the top of the food chain.&nbsp;  With the
Aborigines' arrival came their pet dogs (Dingos).&nbsp;  As with
the Wild dogs of New Guinea, the dingo was a more effective hunter
and breeder.&nbsp;  Thylacines where quickly diminished from the
mainland.&nbsp;  The last sign of one on mainland Australia is
a fossil found in West Australia, which is 3,100 years old.<P>
 
The Thylacine found refuge on the island of Tasmania, which was
once connected to
the continent by a land bridge, and became the only place on Earth
where Thylacines were found.&nbsp;  As the dingo did not occur in
Tasmania, the Thylacine was able to exist relatively undisturbed
until European occupation.<P>

The Europeans settled in mainland Australia in 1803.&nbsp;  Upon their
arrival the settlers noticed the continent's bounty of strange
animals.&nbsp;  Reports of a tiger like animal where starting to
be taken notice of.&nbsp;  In 1808 the first Thylacine was shot
and that same year George Harris, Deputy Surveyor of Van Diemen's
Land (Now known as Tasmania), published the first scientific description.<P>

The Thylacine preyed on chickens and sheep belonging to the new
settlers.&nbsp; As a consequence many Thylacines were shot</FONT>

by land holders.&nbsp;  It didn't take long for the conflicts
with the farmers to be dealt with more seriously.&nbsp;  By
1836 the Van Diemen's Land Company was employing full-time
Thylacine trappers and by 1840 rewards of ten shilling each
were paid for scalps.<P>

<CENTER><TABLE WIDTH="80%" CELLPADDING="0" CELLSPACING="0"><TR><TD><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="helvetica,arial">In
1863, when the Thylacines were under no threat, John
Gould made the following observation:&nbsp; <I>When the comparatively
small island of Tasmania becomes more densely populated, and
its primitive forests are intersected with roads from the
eastern to the western coast of Tasmania, the numbers of this
singular animal will speedily diminish, extermination will have
its full sway, and it will then, like the Wolf in England and
Scotland, be recorded as an animal of the past</I>.</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER>

<FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#999900"><B>The Government Intervenes</B></FONT><P>

The Tasmanian Government came into the business in 1888 and introduced a
bounty scheme from 1888-1908, paying £1 (=$2) for an adult and 10 shillings
(=$1) for pups.&nbsp; The reward for adults was the equivalent to half the
weekly wage in 1888.&nbsp; The number of bounties paid by the government
totaled 2063.&nbsp; Skins were exported to be made into waistcoats.&nbsp;
 However, more deaths were probably caused by the Dingo, Aborigines and vagabonds.<P>

<TABLE WIDTH="100%" CELLPADDING="0" CELLSPACING="0"><TR><TD WIDTH="100%">
<FONT FACE="helvetica,arial">Bounties on the animal were officially ended in 1909, but the Thylacine was
still being hunted down as late as 1930.&nbsp;  Europeans changed the habitat
of the Thylacine and that of its prey when they cleared parts of the land for
farming and logging purposes.&nbsp; The construction of dams flooded Thylacine
habitat.&nbsp;  This, combined with the bounty scheme and a possible disease<SUP>1</SUP>,
drastically reduced the numbers of Thylacines until, around 1920, there were only
a few left<SUP>2</SUP>.&nbsp;  This was more pressure on the population than it was able
to withstand.&nbsp;  Population numbers had decreased to below the number
required for survival of the species.</FONT><P></TD>

In 1929 the Thylacine reached the verge of extinction and was protected
during that December which was thought to be their main breeding time.&nbsp;
There was no success in breeding them in captivity despite the large number
that went through zoos around the world.<P>

In 1930 at Mawbanna in the far north-west corner of Tasmania, a hunter
named Wilf Batty made the last know kill of a Thylacine in the wild.<P>

<FONT FACE="helvetica,arial">
 In 1933, the last known specimen was captured and sold to Beaumauris Zoo in
 Hobart, where it was named Benjamin.<P>
In 1936 a law was passed declaring Thylacines as a protected species, but
only two months later at 6pm on September 6th, 1936, Benjamin died in Hobart
Zoo.&nbsp;  The Thylacine was declared officially extinct (There was no
success in breeding them in captivity despite the large number that went
through zoos around the world).&nbsp; Less than fifty years had passed
since the Tasmanian Government placed the £1 bounty on their scalps.</FONT></TD>

A reason for the Tasmanian Tiger becoming extinct in Tasmania could be that
there was little public pressure to try to preserve them.&nbsp; Only one
man seemed to care, Mr T Flynn who suggested that some be put on an island
to re-populate, but nothing was done.&nbsp; Since then, DNA testing has proved
that the Thylacine is the only modern
member of its family.&nbsp;  The Thylacine has been officially declared
extinct under the Tasmanian Threatened Species Protection Act of 1995.<P>

Today the only remains of the Tasmanian Tiger apart from supposed sightings
are photos, paintings and short black and white films in museums, and one
adult and pouch young preserved in alcohol.&nbsp;  Interestingly, all the
photographs of live Thylacines are of captive animals; there are no
photographs of the animals in the wild.<P>

The Thylacine is not mourned as a lost species like the extinct dodo or
the European bison, not nurtured and cherished like the rare and extremely
endangered pandas or Californian condors.&nbsp;  Being so dog-like it has
a natural appeal to human emotions and this does not allow us to easily
write off the Thylacine.

<SUP>1</SUP>&nbsp; In 1910 an epidemic rather like distemper, and possibly brought by
domestic dogs, may have reduced the already dangerously low population.<P>

<SUP>2</SUP>&nbsp; Between 1888-1914 at least 2,268 Thylacines are known to have
been killed and turned in.<P>
