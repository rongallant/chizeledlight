The Thylacine was a carnivore, and its prey consisted mostly of kangaroos,
pademelons, wallabies, small mammals and birds.&nbsp; The animal also
preyed on domestic sheep introduced when Europeans settled in Tasmania.&nbsp;
The sheep were easy targets, and the Thylacine was easily blamed for any
sheep losses.&nbsp; The Thylacine was the largest carnivorous marsupial
during the last 20,000 years, so it played an important role as
the top predator in its food chain.<P>

The Thylacine preferred to hunt at dusk, night or dawn.&nbsp;  Aided by
its remarkably keen sense of smell, its hunting range could cover
an enormous distance, anything up to eighty square kilometers.&nbsp;
Thylacines would usually hunt alone or in pairs, but never in packs.&nbsp;
Upon picking up the scent of a wallaby or some other intended victim,
the Thylacine would follow its prey at a leisurely trot as it was incapable
of any great speed.&nbsp; Slowly, but with great persistence, it gradually
wore down its prey until it showed signs of exhaustion, and finally made
the kill in a short swift rush.&nbsp; The Thylacine was not a fast runner
due to its short hind legs and stiff kangaroo-like tail, which made
manoeuvring difficult at high speeds, especially in forest areas.</FONT>

The Thylacine invariably killed its prey by crushing the skull with
their powerful jaws.&nbsp; In devouring its prey, the Thylacine ate
only selected parts.&nbsp; It was primarily a blood feeder, sucking
blood from the severed jugular vein of its kill.&nbsp; It enjoyed
the vascular parts of its prey such as the throat, nasal tissue,
kidney and liver fat.&nbsp; It is believed that Thylacines ate only
freshly killed meat and never returned to a kill.&nbsp; This was
important because it meant that they could not be poisoned by
settlers who baiting carcasses.<P>
