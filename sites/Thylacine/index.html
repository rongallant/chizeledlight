The Thylacine <A HREF="thylacine.wav"><IMG SRC="graphics/listen.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=16
ALT="Hear 'Thylacine'" BORDER="0">
</A>
is one of the most famous and mysterious of Tasmania's native animals.&nbsp;
Once Australia's largest carnivorous marsupial, the Thylacine has been extinct for over 60
years. The animal's unique characteristics and various unsubstantiated sightings since
its tragic demise has increased the Thylacine's image to mythical proportions.<P>

The name Thylacine is derived from its scientific name, <I>Thylacinus cynocephalus</I>,
which literally means "pouched dog with the wolf head".&nbsp; It is commonly
known as the Tasmanian Tiger
<A HREF="taztiger.wav"><IMG SRC="graphics/listen.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=16
ALT="Hear 'Tasmanian Tiger'" BORDER="0"></A>,
or the Tasmanian wolf, especially in North America.&nbsp;
Other nicknames for this strange animal include Kangaroo Wolf, Zebra Wolf, Hyena
Opossum, Wolf Opossum, and Dog Faced Dasyures.&nbsp; This long list of names is
due to the Thylacine's resemblance to these various animals in a weird
mishmash of different species.<P>

The Thylacine seemed to be half wolf and half tiger in appearance.&nbsp;
The distinctive dark brown stripes, numbering between 13 and 21, that ran
across the back, rump and base of the tail of the Thylacine gave this animal
a tiger-like appearance. The fur itself was short, thick and coarse, and was
sandy yellow-brown to a darker olive brown in colour, with a

belly.&nbsp; The Thylacine resembled a wolf or dog with its big head and very
sharp teeth.&nbsp; Unlike a dog, however, the Thylacine had eight upper
front teeth in the mouth instead of six upper teeth in canine animals.&nbsp;
The Thylacine's paw print is also unlike that of a dog's, with five toes
making an impression, whereas a dog leaves four toe prints.&nbsp; The fifth
canine toe, called a dew claw, is higher up on the ankle, and does not leave
an impression.&nbsp; The animal's short hindquarters are like that of a
hyena's.&nbsp; The Thylacine also has some kangaroo-like features,</FONT>

including a long, thick tail, a large pouch, and a patch of naked skin between the heel
and the hind of the foot.&nbsp; This sometimes appeared in tracks as the
Thylacine was sometimes reported to stand on its hind legs in a kangaroo
position.&nbsp; Like the kangaroo, the base of the tail was thick and rigid,
preventing it from wagging in a dog or wolf-like fashion, and did not have a
long hairy brush.&nbsp; The tail measured approximately 65cm in length and was
covered with short hair.&nbsp; Unlike other marsupials such as the kangaroo and
the opossum, the pouch of a female Thylacine opened from the rear, which served
to protect the young from being scratched or torn by vegetation.<P>

<TABLE WIDTH="100%" CELLPADDING="0" CELLSPACING="0"><TR><TD WIDTH="100%"><FONT FACE="helvetica,arial">
A full grown Thylacine grew to be approximately 180cm (6ft) in length from the nose
to the tip of the tail, and stood about 58 cm (2ft) high at the shoulder.&nbsp;
Adult Thylacines usually weighed between 15 and 35 kg.&nbsp; The largest Thylacine
known measured 290cm (9'6") from the nose to the tip of the long tail!&nbsp; Another
amazing feature of the Thylacine was its enormous gape.&nbsp; Its jaws could open
120 degrees, giving the impression that they were dislocated from the skull
(No other mammal can open its jaws so widely).&nbsp; This and the Thylacine's powerful
jaw muscles made a very effective weapon.</FONT></TD>

Despite the Thylacine's frightening appearance, it is a very shy and secretive
animal, and despite its name "tiger", it has a quiet, nervous temperament
compared to its little cousin, the Tasmanian Devil
<A HREF="taxdevil.wav"><IMG SRC="graphics/listen.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=16 ALT="Hear a Devil" BORDER="0"></A>
<A HREF="graphics/devilsm.jpg"><IMG SRC="graphics/watch.gif" WIDTH=18 HEIGHT=11 ALT="See a Devil" BORDER="0"></A>.&nbsp; The Thylacine was
not a vicious animal, and there are no substantiated accounts of Thylacines
willfully attacking a human.&nbsp; They would bite to defend themselves when
cornered, or when trying to escape.&nbsp; Although the animal was very curious
by nature, being known to follow men through the bush for days at a time,
it was nevertheless very shy, and would head for cover the moment they came
upon it.&nbsp; They seemed to avoid human contact as much as possible.<P>

The Thylacine was a nocturnal animal and was rarely sighted.&nbsp; The first
one was not captured until 1808, five years after the settlement of
Tasmania.&nbsp; By 1820, only four were collected.&nbsp; It is believed that
perhaps no more than 3000 Thylacines ever existed.<P>

We know surprisingly little about the biology of the Thylacine.&nbsp; Much of what we
know about the animal comes from historical records, from studying museum collections,
and from personalized accounts collected by zoologist Eric Guiler in the 1970s
and 1980s.&nbsp; It is not known the exact life span of a Thylacine, but one
in London lived to 10 years and another to 12 years in Tasmania.<P>

Since its extinction, the Thylacine has become somewhat of a mysterious,
mythical and revered animal.&nbsp; The Thylacine is the official symbol for
the State of Tasmania, and it can be seen supporting the Tasmanian State coat
of arms.&nbsp; The animal is also featured on two postage stamps, and has
been symbolized by many groups and organizations to indicate their
Tasmanian connection and/or origins.<P>
