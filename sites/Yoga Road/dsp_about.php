<h1>About yoga Road</h1>

<h2>Catherine Eddins</h2>

<h5>Certified, White Lotus Foundation, Santa Barbara, California</h5>

<p>Trained at the White Lotus Foundation, Catherine utilizes the structure of the &#147;Flow Series&#148; created by it&#146;s founders, Ganga White and Tracey Rich. Classes include the use of breath, focus and alignment to deepen the practice. Catherine helps her students to practice with awareness to be fully present in the moment. Each student is encouraged to make each class &#147;their own&#148;, to know when to challenge their individual limits and when to rest. She strives to make each student welcome and at ease in class.</p>

<p>Catherine inspires steady effort and lightens the work with humor. Classes are designed to strengthen the body and calm the mind - and of course, to have fun doing it!</p>
