											<p>The Multifunction Calendar currently supports two types of calendars, a journal or minutes, a mail form, a summary page and news to be displayed on the summary page. Please read the GNU license for restrictions on usage. Please help support it by making a donation.</p>
											<p><i>Traditional Calendar:</i><br>This is a traditional style calendar that shows links in each day to a event. Details are then displayed when a user clicks on the link. This calendar also supports reoccurrence of events. To do this, this calendar uses a second table to generate the information in calendar display. This should be rebuilt using the rebuild option on the admin page after changing dates of an event, adding a new event and/or at the beginning of each month (this could be handled as a cron job).</p>
											<p><i>List Calendar:</i><br>This is a simple list style calendar. There is an option to display two types of  legends, image and text, for this calendar (both are displayed in the demo).</p>
											<p>Both calendars can either specify a URL or an email address for the contact. In the case of a email address, the address is not published. Instead, visitors are supplied with a form (mail.php). This is intended to thwart any method of &quot;Harvesting&quot; addressed from a web site.</p>
											<p><i>Minutes Journal or Update Log:</i><br>This is provided to supply dated information. This could be used for such purposes as a modification/updates log, minutes, journal, etc... Information is displayed from the most recent.</p>
											<p><i>News:</i><br>This information is displayed on the summery page. Start and stop times are specified to have the entry displayed between two dates. The summery page also displays up-coming events from the traditional and list calendars within a specific number of days (set in the setup.php file).</p>
											<p><i>Requirements:</i><br>PHP 3-4.<br>MySQL 3</p>
