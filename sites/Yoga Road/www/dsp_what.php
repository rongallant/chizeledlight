<h1>What is Yoga?</h1>

<p>The word yoga comes from the Sanskrit root meaning yoke or union. There are many forms of yoga, including the practice of physical postures and breath, which is known as <i>Hatha</i> yoga. The word hatha comes from two roots meaning sun<i>- ha</i> and moon <i>- tha</i>. The word suggests a balance of body and mind, which is the fruit of regular practice. Hatha yoga is designed to balance the opposing energies of the body (active, heating, sun energy and passive, cooling moon energy). Hatha yoga is basically a tool for fine-tuning the ever-changing balance between mind and body.</p>

<h2>What can yoga do for me?</h2>

<p>Practiced regularly, yoga benefits all of the systems of the body. Benefits include increased strength, flexibility and balance. It improves cardiovascular and digestive 
health as well. In addition, regular, focused practice may improve concentration and relieve stress. Yoga will help you to be &#147;alert without tension and relaxed without dullness&#148; (Yoga Sutra as translated by T.K.V. Desikachar)</p>


<h2>I'm not flexible or strong. Can I still do this?</h2>

<p>Definitely! Yoga is for everyone. Unlike most western sports and fitness regimens, yoga is designed to be non competitive. Your only competition is yourself. Start by doing what you can. By practicing at your own level, challenging yourself, as you are ready, the benefits will come.</p>

<blockquote>Yoga is a practice of balance. Working on physical balance and focused awareness help bring equanimity. As with everything else - you get from yoga what you put into it. Yoga is the perfect compliment to any fitness routine. Join us to find out what yoga has to offer!</blockquote>
