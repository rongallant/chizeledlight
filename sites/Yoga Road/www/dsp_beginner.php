<h1>Beginner's Corner</h1>

<h2>What kind of mat should I get?</h2>

<p>The yoga "sticky" mat is a relatively new innovation in yoga.  If you practice on carpet, you may be able to get by without it.  However, if you practice on a hard wood or tile floor, you will want to get one.  "Sticky" is the important word here.  The best mat should have some texture and should feel tacky to the touch -the more, the better.  The whole point is to keep you from slipping.  Your mat should be no more than ¼ inch thick.  More than that feels really nice but puts your wrists and ankles at risk of overextension.  There are countless sources online and many department stores now carry them separately or in kits that include props or videos.  When in doubt, ask the instructor or another student.  They'll be glad to help you find one.</p>


<h2>Downdog getting you down?</h2>


<p>Downdog (Adho Mukha Svanasana) is a tonic pose, which stretches and tones the entire body.  It is often used as rest between more challenging postures and is part of the warm up series known as sun salutations.  You may wonder how a pose that stretches and works you all over could ever be perceived as restful.  The key is in working at your level and sticking with it.  </p>

<p>Getting length in the spine:  Start in the all fours position with your hands aligned directly underneath your shoulders and your knees directly underneath your hips.  Tuck your toes under and lift your hips up towards the ceiling, pushing away from the floor with your hands to take weight off of your hands.  If your legs or hips are tight and already uncomfortable, bend the knees a little and push back again.  Your gaze should be straight back between your feet.  Check to be sure that your feet and legs are parallel and that there is space between them.  The hands should be shoulder width apart and the feet, hip width apart, to maintain balance and alignment.</p>

<p>Working the heels towards the floor:  Now that we have achieved a balanced pose and a good stretch for the spine, let's move to the feet.  If your heels aren't anywhere near the floor and you're already straining, let them be where they are.  To loosen up the calves, try stretching one heel to the floor and then the other, as in a runner's stretch.  In time, the heels will drop down for a complete leg stretch.  If your heels are within an inch of the floor, just step the feet a few inches closer to your hands and try pressing them down again.  </p>

<p>Final adjustment:  Even if the knees are bent, the arms remain straight, hands flat and fingers spread wide.  Keeping the hands flat and the weight shifted back, prevents tension in the wrist and shifts the work to the shoulders.  Above all, keep breathing evenly.  You can always drop to your knees for a few breaths and then lift back into position.  With conscious practice, Downdog will not only become restful, but may become one of your favorite postures.</p>


<h2>Do you Ujjayi?</h2>

<img src="<?echo$images;?>/lotus.jpg" border="2" width="226" height="222" align="right" style="padding-left:10px;">

<p>Ujjayi breath (victorious breath) is just one of many tools to increase your focus and take your practice to the next level.  With practice, you may find that it not only improves concentration in yoga class, but that it is a useful tool for calming the mind at any time, on or off the mat.</p>

<p>If you've ever made a sigh or used your breath to fog up glass to clean it, you can do this technique.  First try breathing out, mouth open, as if to fog up glass.  You'll feel vibration on the back of your throat and perhaps it will sound like a whispered "Ha" sound.  Now, keeping the mouth open, try to create the same sensation and sound as you breathe in.  After your throat gets dry, close your mouth and try to continue to "sigh" in and out as you breathe.  As you do this, your breath will sound like Darth Vader, or like a cappuccino maker.  It may be loud or soft.  Either way, concentrating on breathing this way will quiet the mind and bring clarity and focus to your practice.  So, keep trying and - Breathe some life into your practice!</p>


<h2>Sun Salutations</h2>

<p>As a beginner, the sun salute (Surya Namaskar) can be a challenge.  Sun salutations are used to warm up the body to prepare for practice.  There are at least four main salutation series and numerous variations upon them.  However, once you've mastered one, the others will come easily. After several classes you'll have it down. However, if you'd like to learn them to practice at home, ask your instructor for help.  He or she may be able to draw it out for you or can refer you to a book or website with illustrations to guide you.  Whether practiced slowly or with a vigorous pace, the main point is to oxygenate the body and get moving.   Once you've gotten them down, sun salutations are a great warm up for any physical activity and a great way to start your day.  <b>(Shown below is the A Series Salutation)</b></p>

<h2>The perfect pose - How do you know when you are there?</h2>

<p>If you've looked at yoga magazines and books you probably have an idea of what a perfect pose looks like.  And perhaps a lot of the poses look unattainable.  Especially in western culture, there is a continuous striving for achievement and perfection in any activity.  So, on the surface, it may seem that practicing yoga is about achieving some level of perfection in any given posture.  However, there is much more to it than that.</p>

<p>As you practice regularly, you'll discover that some poses do involve some striving, while others require surrender of muscular tension, breath and even the ego in order to make "progress". There must be some striving if you want to move forward. However, each of our bodies is unique in its personal history and it's current state. Everyone has different strengths and weakness that they bring to the mat. With that in mind, the perfect pose, in any pose, then becomes what is right for your body at that given time. Practicing yoga reminds us to remain in the moment and to let go of all else. Remember that the "map is not the road". The perfect pose happens when there is balance between striving and letting go. It is about being "alert without tension and relaxed without dullness" (yoga sutra as translated by T.K.V. Desikachar)</p>


<h2>Namaste - What does it mean?</h2>

<p>Namaste is commonly used to end class.  In Indian cultures, the praying hands gesture (Anjali Mudra) is a symbol of balance, bringing dualities together to create unity.  It implies that all is One.   It is usually accompanied by a bow of the head with hands together as in prayer, touching the chin or forehead between the eyes.  Bringing the hands to touch the crown of the head shows even deeper reverence.  </p>

<p>In Sanskrit 'namas' is a reverent greeting and 'te' means 'to you'.  Very simply put, it means, "I honor you".   Though used as a greeting, its meaning is much deeper than that.  India's rich culture recognizes the Divine in that dwells in every living thing and all of nature.  And in that way, each of us is thus a reflection of each other.  Namaste in one word embraces both the personal in the infinite, bridging the gap of dualities to bring us together in peace and unity.</p>
