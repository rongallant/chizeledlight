                <td width="100%">The art of Kodokan Judo was
                derived from the bujutsu (ancient martial or
                warlike) arts of feudal Japan. Predominant among
                these arts was that of jujitsu. The founder of
                Kodokan Judo (Judo for short) was Dr. Jigoro
                Kano, a Rhodes Scholar, and a noted educator in
                Japan, who took the art of judo and used hi
                influence to establish in Japanese school. This
                art was the instrument that put judo on the world
                stage and later into the Olympic Games. Today,
                the sport and art of judo is practiced in over 92
                countries throughout the world.&nbsp; <p>Since
                Jujitsu school were in a state of disrepute by
                the members of Japanese society for being too
                violent, many of the jujitsu schools came
                together. Kano's judo was an amalgamation of some
                of the more popular jujitsu schools of Japan.
                Prominent among these were the Tenshin Shinyo Ryu
                and the Kito Ryu schools. When asked why the term
                judo was used instead of jujitsu, Kano replied
                &quot;What I teach is not simply jujitsu. Of
                course I teach jujitsu, but it is upon 'do' (way
                or principle).&quot; In addition to encompassing
                the best of many jujitsu arts, Kano's judo also
                reflected a broader range of techniques.&nbsp; </p>
                <p>Judo is still encompassing the five elements
                of defense as used in old jujitsu: throwing,
                grappling, joint locks, strangulation and
                striking (striking is only practiced in kata or
                formal forms, and not in competition). The old
                methods have been refined and modified to take in
                sport as well as methods of fighting which
                reflect modern society. In 1964, judo was
                officially accepted as a sport in the modern
                Olympics, and has participated in every Olympics
                ever since.</p>
