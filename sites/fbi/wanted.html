<B>On this page is the most netorious criminal minds ever to walk the face
of our planet.&nbsp; We have worked on there cases for many years, in some
instances we have yet to conclude what or who the individual is.&nbsp; </B>

<BR><BR><BR><BR>

<H3>Case 1:&nbsp; Lyle Lovette</H3><P>
This man, known as a "freak", has been spotted dating the beautifull Julia
Roberts.&nbsp; We know from years of training that a woman like Ms.&nbsp; Roberts, would
never be caught dead with the likes of Mr. Lovette.&nbsp; So we have concluded
that he is using either mind altering drugs or ESP mind control to seduce these
women into being with him.<P>
This man is dangerous if you are in the top 10% of good looking
women.

<H3>Case 2:&nbsp; The Thylacine</H3><P>
This creature has been seen in the movie <U>Howling 4</U>. Known to be extinct since the
30s, Sightings are still in occourance.<P>
This animal is very dangourus. Be on the lookout for a pair of jaws the size of a whales.<P>
