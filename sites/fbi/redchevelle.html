In 1979, I was fishing of the shores of Newfoundland, Canada.&nbsp; The weather was
bad as usual and it was getting dark.&nbsp; It was 21:30 hours and was near past my
bed time.<P>

The water was choppy all day, then within seconds it was totally calm.&nbsp;
I was just sitting there in the middle of the water in a little dory boat.&nbsp; 
Alone and afraid of what might come next.&nbsp; Little did I imagine what would
come would change my life for ever.<P>

Out of the water came the hughist fish I have ever seen heard of or even could
believe.&nbsp;  It was black and slimy, and had whiskers on its face
like a catfish.&nbsp; The fin on its back was at least 15 feet out of the water.&nbsp;
This was no ordinary fish buddy.<P>

It came within 4 or 5 feet of the boat
so I took a swing at it's head with my paddle.&nbsp; As I swung near it's massive
head, it bit my paddle right in two.&nbsp; Now I was mad, this was my favorite
paddle, the paddle that my fore fathers have been passing down for many generations.&nbsp;
And now way in hell was I letting a humongous jelly lump get away with it.<P>

Now we have all heard the stories of the 70 year old lady who picked up a car to 
save her grandson, or the father who ran a marathon in record time to save his
kid from cholking at home.  But I can tell you that when that heaven for the cod
liver oil industry broke my paddle, I got the strength of 10 men.&nbsp; I jumped
out of the boat and on to it's back.  I rode it like a rodeo horse for 30 minutes.&nbsp;
I'll never understand why it surfaced in the first place, but even more confusing was
why it never went under the whole time I was riding it.&nbsp; Well at least not 
until after.<P>

As soon as I was on the mega guppies back, it bolted in a direction away from shore
that all the locals know is just open water.&nbsp; But as we went further, I noticed
a small island appear as from out of nowhere.&nbsp; The fish came up to a dock and
like a passenger boat let me get off.&nbsp; I was met buy 4 people in white
suits.&nbsp; The kind of suits they use to examine ebola patients.&nbsp; They grabbed
me and took me inside a huge hanger type building.&nbsp; I wasn't afraid, but my
curiosity was getting to me so I fought against them with all my strength.&nbsp;
This never helped the situation.  One of then knocked me unconscious and it was lights out.<P>

When I woke up, I was standing up fully dresses in a uniform next to several other
people who looked as confused as me.&nbsp; A man entered the room.&nbsp; He also
wore this suit.&nbsp; He told us how we were all being watched by there servants
underwater, whom he called the Pinny (He was referring to the fish I rode in on).&nbsp; 
He said that our families were watched for over 50 years and we were picked by them for
our temperament and unusual traits.&nbsp; Then he took a mirror around the room
and put it in front of each of us.&nbsp; We all broke down in horror.  We had all aged.&nbsp;
15 years to be exact.<P>

We were brought here, trained and had worked in the general public sector of the
FBI for the last 15 years, all this to be ready for the day when we would join the
very secret sector of the bureau.&nbsp; The Hine sector.&nbsp; This sector is
resposible for keeping the tabloids from being believable.&nbsp; Any unusual
events that happen are our turf.&nbsp; Now I know you have all seen the X-Files,
this is a load of crap. There are and never will be agents who work in the
general public sector who do the work we do.&nbsp;  But yes, most of the cases
documented on this series is directly from our file cabinets.
<P>

And thats all I have to say about that...
