I have blond hair, blue, 
green, hazel, eyes, (depending on the mood.) I always wear dark colors, 
and my navy bell bottoms. I have very pale skin and I weigh 123 lbs. I 
wear reeboks and never wear makeup or jewlry. To put me in one word, it 
would be plain.</A></TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER>

	I want to be in this because I'm always discluded from every damn thing I 
apply to.&nbsp; If you people are blake's friend, then you must be cool.&nbsp; My friends at 
school are dissing me and today I just got told that all my friends 
think I'm annoying because sometimes I like to eat with my fingers, and 
the thing is, they do too.&nbsp; Sometimes I just want to be part of something 
that none of my other friends can.&nbsp; Sometimes I just wish they would all 
die and go to hell if you know what I mean.&nbsp; I told this girl off and 
said, I hope you burn in hell you b****!&nbsp; If you haven't been able to 
tell yet, I'm a very disturbed person.&nbsp; My father was an alchoholic, he 
beat my mother.&nbsp; I have no idea why I'm telling you this.&nbsp; Maybe to 
fill the void that will be empty cause I won't have enough words.&nbsp; Oh 
well.&nbsp; I think I need new people, people who are my people.&nbsp; I have one 
sister, and I'm pretty close to her.&nbsp; But if she knew about this, well, 
she won't know about this.&nbsp; I took that oath thing already and no one 
knows about it.&nbsp; Please don't take me for a fool because I know this is
the F.B.I. I wonder what they would do if they saw this?&nbsp;
Well, I don't think I'll be able to fit five hundred words in 
here. I can only type about 350 in fifteen minutes.

I have blond hair, 
blue, green, hazel, eyes,(depending on the mood.) Well, I think this 
should be enough.
