The summer of 1997 will
always remain in my mind.  It all began when I was outside cooking some
hamburgers on the grill.&nbsp; Nobody was home, but I was going to go
over to my friend Jason's house for supper.&nbsp; Jason lived in a boat.&nbsp;
A very nice boat.&nbsp; But hey, all good things come to an end right?&nbsp;
Two hours later, me, Jason, and his girlfriend sat down to hamburgers.&nbsp;
We were out on his floating deck eating.&nbsp; I had just put some mayo
on my bun when something hit the deck.&nbsp; I almost flew over the edge
but I grabbed the railing.&nbsp; I pulled myself back onto the boat.&nbsp;
I heard Jason yell to me for help.&nbsp; I ran over to him.&nbsp; He was
also thrown over the railing.&nbsp; I grabbed his arm and helped him back
up onto the boat. I looked at the shore.<P>

That was when I first saw, the Vodo Indians.&nbsp; 
(I know this is corny!).&nbsp; I screamed as one
of the arrows tried to turn me into a Vodo doll.&nbsp;
I blacked out as something hit me in my head.&nbsp; When I awoke, I was
adrift on a piece of wood.&nbsp; I looked at the distant houses, and I
could tell that I was somewhere on the Hudson river.&nbsp; Perhaps by
the fork where it met the Mohawk because I could feel a slight current.&nbsp;
When I did reach land, I found a house.&nbsp;  Inside this house lived an
old old old lady.&nbsp; She was older then the hills.&nbsp; But she had some
marvelous pieces of electronic equipment.&nbsp; I stayed at this house for
many moons.&nbsp; Until the summer of 1998.&nbsp; Everything I learned during
the year helped me.&nbsp; I could construct a radio from nothing but dirt.&nbsp;
And I could use anything as a weapon.&nbsp; I was a worn-in fighting
machine.<P>

Two days after I had left, I entered a bar.&nbsp; I
sat down for a short rest.&nbsp;  I heard some yelling and looked over.&nbsp;
The chef was getting in a fight with a costumer.&nbsp; The costumer didnt want
him to fry the fish.&nbsp; I remembered seeing the fish below Jasons boat
when I was hanging onto the railing.&nbsp; They were huge.&nbsp; I hated
fish.&nbsp; (Yes, I know this want mentioned above).&nbsp; My hand landed
on a can of toothpicks.&nbsp; I looked at them just as the costumer
slapped the chef.&nbsp; The fish fell to the ground and the costumer
picked him up.&nbsp; But before he could do anything, three long
toothpicks implanted themselves into the head of the fish.&nbsp; In rapid
succesion I had let the toothpicks fly.&nbsp; The fish was dead.<P>

I stood up to leave, but that is when I met her.&nbsp; Captain Caffinated
Hallmark.&nbsp; She got me into the FBI.&nbsp; Where I am now.&nbsp; I will
give anything for her plans to go right.<P>
