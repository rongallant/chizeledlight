I was sitting up late at night looking pictures from a vacation when I
heard a strange noise.&nbsp; It sounded like a loud whisper.&nbsp;
My body froze, and I felt that feeling of fear in my stomach.&nbsp; Then
I remembered the radio was on and I only had to fart.&nbsp;
So I went back to looking at the pictures.<P>

I was at the young age of 14, the night of my birthday, and I got so bored
I went downstairs.&nbsp; It was really dark so I went for the lightswitch.&nbsp;
I raised my hand to flip on the overhead lamp when two small glowing balls
appeared in the darkness of the living room.<P>

I had that same feeling in
my stomach, but this time, I knew it was fear.&nbsp; They started moving,
and as they got closer, a face appeared. I realized it was a person, and
they had yet to realize I was there.&nbsp; They crept closer to my general direction,
when I noticed their face.<P>

I had been watching the news the day before
and there was an alert about a mad man who was on a killing spree.&nbsp; It was
him!<BR> I just stood in my dark Joe Boxer boxers and Seasame Street
t-shirt.&nbsp; As soon as the man left my side door, he sat down outside.&nbsp;
I guess he thought no one was home, because my dad was over getting drunk with
Ronald McDonald at the local bar.<P>

I went out there and kicked his ass like Jackie Chan!&nbsp; That's when I
decided to join the Eaton's savings club.&nbsp; It was a while after, when
I was 14 1/4 and I thought I should join the club against Starbucks,
trying to take over Canadian Second Cup. I eventually was taken away by
the Italian Mofia and taught special skills like kicking ass and the
secrets of walking quietly.
