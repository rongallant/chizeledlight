Well the name's Leblanc, Marc Leblanc.&nbsp; I specialize in web design & sub
atomic destruction.&nbsp; I go by the code name M.e.r.s.h. (Man eating, really
scary human).&nbsp; I got that name from a mission back in '67 when I destroyed
our countries arch nemisis "Mr. Evil guy ".&nbsp; This of course was back
when arch nemisis's didn't need really groovy names.&nbsp; But enough about me.<P>

The real trouble has been a problem here in canada.&nbsp; It seems that Mr Evil
Guy's even eviler twin has surfaced to avenge the death of his brother.&nbsp;
He is attempting to do this by raising the temperatur of my fine country by 10
degree's.&nbsp; As any good american citizen knows, this will melt all the igloo's,
cause the polar bear population to decrease.&nbsp; And there will be no more  
ice brewed beer!&nbsp; Which as a canaidian is our life line and only source of
nourishment.&nbsp; This is where I call in you guy's for help.&nbsp; I must become an
agent so that I can get a green card to get out of this feeble country and hide my
self from Mr. Evil Guy's brother .. cuz he's really big.
