As an example of a frames-based site showcasing last month's JavaScript Jump Menu Lesson, I built the Web Design Secrets Archive as a compact, floating pop-up window that you can explore. Click on the image button below to activate the pop-up window. You'll notice that I've used borderless frames and I've integrated a convenient "EXIT" button that closes the pop-up window when you are ready to return to the lesson.
