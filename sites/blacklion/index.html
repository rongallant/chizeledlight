	<p>This is a review of the Orient M-Force model CEX0F002B. In the collectors world it is known as the <a href="http://www.28thinfantry.org/" target="_blank">Black Lion</a>.</p>
	<p><a href="http://www.orientalwatchsite.com/" target="_blank">The Oriental Watch Site</a> has come up with a great idea of passing around a watch to it's members and having them review the watch. In doing so your review will be judged by the members and the winner will end up owning the watch. Now, I being a WIS (Watch Idiot Savant ) and a big fan of Oriental watches, loved this idea and jumped at the chance to be part of it.</p>
	<p>In the end, it is all fun and the owner will have a watch that has a little bit of all of us attached. It may have some little nicks from all over the world. It may contains remnants of sand from Hawaii and Florida. It will have a family photo album from around the globe.</p>
	<p>Here are my thoughts and opinions of the Orient Black Lion.</p>
	
	<a name="packaging"></a><h2>Packaging</h2>
	<a href="photo.php?photo=assets/box.jpg" ><img src="assets/box_tmb.jpg" align="right" alt="box" border="1" style="margin-left:10px;" /></a>
	<p>The Lion comes in a green paper bag containing a green leatherette box with gold leaf inlaid text and designs.</p>
	
	<br clear="all" />
	
	<p>The quality of the box is on par with watches retailing over $1000 US.</p>
	
	<a href="photo.php?photo=assets/tag.jpg" ><img src="assets/tag_tmb.jpg" align="right" alt="tag" border="1" style="margin-left:10px;" /></a>
	
	<p>Attached to the watch are several tags that describe the watch. The green and gold Orient Crest, the M-Force and a model number.</p>
	<h4>Rating 7/10</h4>
	
	<a name="bezel"></a><h2>Bezel</h2>
	<P>The bezel on the Lion is a rather attractive. It is stainless steel with black filled numbers from 00 to 60 in increments of 5. The Lion bezel is unidirectional and somewhat low profile. The configuration of the bezel however, makes it hard to grip and turning it somewhat difficult. Forget trying to adjust with wet hands.</p>
	<h4>Rating 6/10</h4>
	
	<a name="dial"></a><h2>Dial</h2>
	<p>The first things that really stick out when you look at this watch are the orange second and power reserve hands and modernistic black dial. Very striking and refreshingly different from the usual "classic" designs that Orient tended to put out in the past. The black dial has a matte center and a texture in a circular pattern that resembles a vinyl LP record.</p>
	<p>The Hands are rather large and are very legible. The luminescence on the hands however is on par with most other Orients, POOR. No Seiko Monster here. After about an hour you had better have night vision turned on.</p>
	<h4>Rating 7/10</h4>
	
	<a name="case"></a><h2>Case/Crown</h2>	
	<a href="photo.php?photo=assets/caseback.jpg" ><img src="assets/caseback_tmb.jpg" align="right" alt="box" border="1" style="margin-left:10px;" /></a>	
	<p>When I first lifted the Lion out of the box, I realized that this was no lightweight. The Lion weighs in at 181g and is a solid chunk stainless steel. For a reference, the Seiko Monster (SKX779) on a bracelet is 160g.</p>
	<p>The Lion's case is 43mm without the crown and 14mm thick. It is water resistant up to 100m which makes it perfect for most recreational swimming. Screw down crown and case back are both here. The case back has a great holographic sticker on it. I belive this may help verify authenticity as the one on Rolex's does. The case I do not believe Orient is posing this watch as a diver and I will not take away points for not being one. This is a Sport watch and is modeled for that purpose.</p>
	<p>The case sports a domed mineral crystal. This makes the face very easy to read glare free.  However, since the bezel is not raised, it also makes it prone to scratching.</p>
	
		<a href="photo.php?photo=assets/crown.jpg" ><img src="assets/crown_tmb.jpg" align="right" alt="box" border="1" style="margin-left:10px;" /></a>	
	<p>The crown is of the screw down variety to insure the 100m water tightness and has the crest of lions carved into it. The crown is of sufficient diameter to make setting the time an effortless task. The crown is &quot;protected&quot; by two small protrusion. I believe this is more of a design feature than useful. The small crown guards also deter from the look of the watch by taking away from the otherwise rugged looks. (wimpy little nubs)</p>

	<a name="movement"></a><h2>Movement</h2>
	<img src="assets/movement.jpg" align="right" alt="box" border="1" style="margin-left:10px;" />
	<p>The movement in the watch is Orients in house automatic 46G, 21 jewels. The same movement as the Orient Beast. The movement has a hour/minute/second hand on the center column, 40 hours power reserve and a date window in the 3 o'clock position. You can quick change the date using a button located in the 2 o'clock position. The location of this button and ease to press it is a pain most of the time because you can advance the date easily by mistake. However, if the date needs to be advanced at the end of the month from 31 to 1, it is a welcomed feature. This differs from some of Orients other movements where the day, not the date, is attached to the quick change button. I see no usefulness to this feature. So this is an improvement at the very least.</p>
	<p>The second day I checked the time and the Lion was off by 10 seconds. This is typical for this movement. I am sure a visit to the jeweler could have this running under 4 seconds.</p>
	<p>This watch has what I now consider my favorite complication on an automatic. This is the first watch I have worn with the <a href="http://www.orolus.com/watchglossary02.shtml#P" target="_blank">power reserve</a> feature.  It is so great to shake this watch in the morning and observe the little indicator move from 0 to 5 then 10 hours power reserve.</p>
	<h4>Rating 7/10</h4>
	
	<a name="bracelet"></a><h2>Bracelet</h2>
	<a href="photo.php?photo=assets/bracelet.jpg" ><img src="assets/bracelet_tmb.jpg" align="right" alt="box" border="1" style="margin-left:10px;" /></a>
	<p>The end links are of the hollow variety and rattled when I had the watch. This is easily fixed by removing the strap and pressing down on the tabs on the rear of the beacelet end link and helps with some of the fit issues you see in solid end link setups. A definite unique feature of the Lion is its bracelet.  The last link before the end links is huge. When you look down at the watch you see the face and only the two top links.  This adds to the watches modern utilitarian look. The links curve to fit your wrist.  My wrists are 6 1/2&quot; around and this watch is very comfortable.</p>
	
	<a href="photo.php?photo=assets/clasp.jpg" ><img src="assets/clasp_tmb.jpg" align="right" alt="box" border="1" style="margin-left:10px;" /></a>
	<p>The clasp is the traditional diver double deployment variety and a solid hinge and the orient logo deeply pressed in the clasp. Very well made.</p>
	<p> Because the strap is not integrated, you can enjoy trying on other straps. I would have loved to see this on a Zulu or Rhino.</p>
	<h4>Rating 8/10</h4>
	
	<a name="conclusion"></a><h2>Conclusion</h2>
	<a href="photo.php?photo=assets/lionincase.jpg"><img src="assets/lionincase_tmb.jpg" align="right" alt="box" border="1" style="margin-left:10px;" /></a>
	<p>The Orient M-Force (Black Lion) is a great looking watch. If your looking for something a little modern, or &quot;techy&quot; looking, I suggest you take a look. It makes me this of <a href="http://www.missionimpossible.com/" target="_blank"><i>Mission Impossible</i></A>. At 43mm this is no small wimpy watch.  With the huge case and very thick bracelet, you &quot;feel&quot; this baby on your wrist. The Orange hands and contrasting black dial beg to be looked at. I had many comments around the office. Something I do not get often with my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chizeledlight/sets/1599017/" target="_blank">other watches</a>.
	<br />At this price point, I would not change a thing.  I would have maybe said solid end links, but I have come to love the ability to adjust these to a perfect fit without bending my spring bars.</p>
	<p>Just go get one.</p>
	<h4>Overall Rating 7/10</h4>
	
	<hr />
	
	<p>I have to say that for a week I really enjoyed holding on to this watch.  It is sort of a friend of mine.  It traveled on my wrist or in my camera bag all over Jacksonville and Northern Florida.  Since we have been tasked with taking a photo of the Lion with a local landmark, I instantly thought of the &quot;<a href="http://www.staugustine.com/bridge/" target="_blank">Bridge of Lions</a>&quot; in St. Augustine. To my dismay, and for the first time in my six years in Florida, the Lions were not by the bridge.  They have been removed for safe keeping while they build a new bridge, Ahhggg!!!<br />So I headed back to Jacksonville and took this photo in front of our landmark, the Modis building (Yippee).</p>

	<p>I would like to thank Neil, Gary and the Oriental Watch Site for letting me partake in this experience. Great group of people there.</p>
