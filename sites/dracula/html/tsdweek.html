<H2>TRANSYLVANIAN WEEKEND in NEWFOUNDLAND</H2><BR><BR>
<P>The Newfoundland members of the Canadian Chapter of the Transylvanian Society of Dracula
celebrated the Centennial Year of Stoker's <I>Dracula</I> with a "Transylvanian Weekend" on October
3-6, 1997. While some of the events were for members and guests only, two events were open to
the public:<BR><BR>
<P>A PUBLIC LECTURE by Dr. Raymond McNally (Boston College) on the topic "Vlad the
Impaler (Dracula): A Case Study in Terror". Dr. McNally is a world renowned historian whose
books include <I>In Search of Dracula</I>,  <I>Dracula: A Biography of Vlad the Impaler</I> and <I>Dracula:
Prince of Many  Faces</I>. He has made numerous appearances on TV documentaries on A&amp;E  and
Discovery Channel.<BR><BR>
<P>Dr. McNally also gave an illustrated talk on the 1922 German movie "Nosferatu".<BR><BR>
<P>TSD members and guests (including McNally) held a special Transylvanian Dinner. All of the
food was from traditional Transylvanian recipes, and included all of the items mentioned by
Jonathan Harker in the early chapters of <I>Dracula</I>: mamaliga, impletata, chicken paprika hendl, and
"robber steak". Also on hand was a goodly supply of Romanian "tuica" (plum brandy) with a
"Vlad Tepes" label!<BR><BR>
