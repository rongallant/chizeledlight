I have decided to cover a range of topics dealing with Stoker, _Dracula_
and vampires, with interviews and articles. During the past
couple of years, I have been interviewed dozens of times by various media
(radio, television and print). I am including the text of some of those
interviews (more to be added), a link to another, as well as one done by
another Dracula enthusiast, with permission.
