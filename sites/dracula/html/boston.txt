"STOKER UNDEAD"
Boston College, November 8-9.

A REPORT

This conference was held on the occasion of Bram Stoker's 150th birthday
(November 8). It was organized by Raymond McNally and David Thiele of
Boston College with assistance from Elizabeth Miller. Here is a personal
account of the event.

----------
Excitement started for me before I arrived. En route to Boston, I stopped
in Halifax (Nova Scotia) to change planes. By pre-arrangement I was
met by the daughter-in-law of the late Sir Devendra Varma (Gothic scholar
who taught for many years at Dalhousie University). The family had agreed
to lend us their copy of _Dracula_ (first edition) to display at the
Boston College conference. It was, of course, insured. I transported
it back and forth. And to make it even better, it was an AUTOGRAPHED copy.

The conference was held at Boston College and hosted by Raymond McNally.
The college campus is quite beautiful and several of the buildings are of
Gothic style. In fact, one could not ask for a better setting for giving
papers on Dracula than the Burns Library. Wonderful atmosphere - even
though it rained almost steadily for the 3 days we were there.

The papers were excellent. Some of the presenters were: Carol Senf,
Margaret Carter, Raymond McNally, Benjamin Leblanc, Radu Florescu,
Cornelia Bodea (Romanian historian), Michael Bell (Rhode Island
folklorist), Stephanie Moss, Katie Harse, Sharon Russell, Jeanne Youngson,
Lloyd Worley, Laura Kaye Stoker, Daniel Lapin, Kellie Donovan Wixson, and
others - and, of course, Bloofer!

Of special interest to me was a paper by Benjamin Leblanc in which he
presented slides of a NEWLY DISCOVERED portrait of Vlad the Impaler which
he found in Austria. It is a full-length portrait. I also enjoyed Michael
Bell's talk about New England vampires. Of course, I enjoyed them all, but
these were the highlights for me.

Another highlight was Chelsea Quinn Yarbro, who was guest speaker at the
banquet on Saturday night. She spoke about how she moved from an interest
in Dracula to the creation of Saint-Germain. We also had a visit
from Vlad the Impaler (Dann Maurno, who those of you at Dracula 97
will remember as one of the winners at the Costume Contest); he did 
a reading from the "voivode Dracula" section of Stoker's novel.
Following the banquet we had a showing of the restored "Nosferatu" which
was quite interesting.

On Sunday night, those of us who were still around were invited to a small
reception at the Romanian Consulate, hosted by Radu Florescu.

Unlike "Dracula 97" which had a broader focus, this conference was
academic. That usually means "dry" - but that was not the case. Papers on
Dracula are always interesting - well, most times! :) I expect that will
be the last major conference for the Dracula Centennial Year. It was a
fine way to bring it to a close.
