Here is a useful list of secondary sources (books) for students doing
research on Dracula. Please note that it is by no means a complete
bibliography, and that it is limited to books with significant sections on
Dracula. The annotations are my own personal assessments.

This list will be updated periodically. (Last update: December 1998)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Auerbach, Nina. _Our Vampires, Ourselves_. Chicago: Chicago University
Press, 1995.
[The text explores, among other things, the predominance of the vampire in
twentieth century America as an indication that vampires go where national
power is. An interesting cultural/political analysis.]

Auerbach, Nina and David J. Skal (eds). _Dracula_. Norton Critical
Edition,1997.
[This new text of _Dracula_ is worth including here because of the wealth
of secondary material it contains. In addition to the full text of the
novel, the editors include early reviews of the novel, a section on
contexts and a range of critical articles (mostly focusing on film/theatre
studies and gender studies).]

Belford, Barbara. _Bram Stoker_. New York: Knopf, 1996.
[A new biography of Bram Stoker, with quite a bit of previously 
unpublished material, including photographs. A most useful book, even 
though the author is intent on pushing one interpretation of _Dracula_: 
that Count Dracula is based on Henry Irving.]

Bunson, Matthew. _The Vampire Encyclopedia_. New York: Crown, 1993.
[Contains many useful pieces of information about a wide range of 
vampire-related topics; unfortunately, also contains several errors. 
Approach with caution and a bit of skepticism.]

Carter, Margaret. _Shadow of a Shade: A Survey of Vampirism in 
Literature_. New York: Gordon, 1975. 
[A useful overview of the representation of vampires in literature, with 
background on pre-Stoker vampire fiction.]

Carter, Margaret (ed). _Dracula: The Vampire and the Critics_. Ann Arbor: 
UMI Press, 1988.
[This collection of essays is a "must" for the serious Dracula scholar; 
it covers a wide range of critical interpretations of Stoker's novel from 
the points of view of a number of well-known scholars.]

Cox, Greg. _The Transylvanian Library: A Consumer's Guide to Vampire 
Fiction_. San Bernardino: Borgo, 1993.
[If Dracula has given you a taste for more vampire fiction, this is a 
good place to start; it provides a fairly comprehensive list of what is 
out there, with ratings provided (in bats!)]

Davison, Carol M. (ed). _Bram Stoker's Dracula: Sucking Through the
Century_. Toronto: Dundurn Press, 1997.
[A superb collection of new critical material on _Dracula_, including
articles by Carol Senf, Margaret Carter, Stephanie Moss, Nina Auerbach,
Veronica Hollinger, Benjamin Leblanc and numerous others. A very useful
and up-to-date "Bloody Bibliography".]

Dresser, Norine. _American Vampires_. New York: Vintage Books, 1990.
[While dealing only marginally with Dracula, this book is essential for
anyone interested in the vampire phenomenon in American culture.]

Farson, Daniel. _The Man Who Wrote Dracula: A Biography of Bram Stoker_. 
London: M.Joseph, 1975.
[A biography of Stoker, controversial because it posits the theory that 
Stoker died of syphilis.]

Florescu, Radu & Raymond McNally. _In Search of Dracula_. 1972. Rev Boston:
Houghton Mifflin, 1994.
[A revised and more comprehensive edition of the original 1972 _In Search of 
Dracula_, one of the major contributions to Dracula studies. The first 
book to trace the connection between Stoker's Dracula and the historical 
figure, Vlad Dracula.]

Florescu, Radu & Raymond McNally. _Dracula: Prince of Many Faces_. 
Boston: Little, Brown, 1989.
[The best available study of Vlad the Impaler, if you are looking for 
detail and historical context.]

Frayling, Christopher. _Vampyres: Lord Byron to Count Dracula_. London: 
Faber and Faber, 1991.
[A useful background to pre-Stoker vampire literature. Also has an 
excellent section on Stoker's working papers and research papers.]

Gelder, Ken. _Reading the Vampire_. London: Routledge, 1994.
[A scholarly treatise of the cultural context of _Dracula_ and other 
vampires in print and in film.]

Glover, David. _Vampires, Mummies, and Liberals_. Durham: Duke University
Press, 1966.
[This scholarly treatise explores Stoker's works in the context of the
cultural and political world of late Victorian England. _Dracula_ is
presented as a transitional work which reflects the conflicts inherent in
19th century liberalism.]

Glut, Donald. _The Dracula Book_. Metuchen N.J.: Scarecrow Press, 1975.
[Only fair on the novel and its genesis, but lengthy and useful section on 
Dracula in the movies.]

Haining, Peter & Peter Tremayne. _The Un-Dead_. London: Constanble, 1997.
[The authors introduce quite a bit of new material about Stoker's life,
and present the questionable theory that George Stoker was a significant
influence for Bram's use of teh historical Dracula.]

Holte, James Craig. _Dracula in the Dark: The Dracula Film Adaptations._
Westport: Greenwood Press, 1997.
[A scholarly survey of Dracula movies from "Nosferatu" to "Dracula, Dead
and Loving It". A very useful book.]

Hughes, William & Andrew Smith (eds). _Bram Stoker: Histiry,
Psychoanalysis and the Gothic_. London: Macmillan, 1998.
[A fine collection of scholarly papers, some on _Dracula_ but also several
on Stoker's lesser known works. Highly recommended for the serious
scholar of Stoker.]

Lapin, Daniel. _The Vampire, Dracula and Incest_. San Francisco: Gargoyle
Publishers, 1995.
[The title says it all. This book, written by a practising psychologist,
examines the vampire in terms of child sexual abuse. It posits the
controversial theory that such abuse may even lie behind the 
writing of _Dracula_.]

Leatherdale, Clive. _Dracula: The Novel and the Legend_. Wellingborough: 
Aquarian, 1985.
[A very useful overview of Stoker and the background of the novel; also 
presents the spectrum of thematic interpretations.]

Leatherdale, Clive. _The Origins of Dracula_. London: Kimber, 1987.
[Excellent for inclusion of material drawn from Stoker's known sources for 
_Dracula_.]

Mascetti, Manuela Dunn. _Vampire: The Complete Guide to the World of the 
Undead_. New York: Viking, 1992.
[A beautifully illustrated book - but of little scholarly use because of 
numerous errors.]

McNally, Raymond T. _Dracula: Truth and Terror_. CD-ROM (Voyager, 1996).
[Dracula can now invade your hard drive with this superb CD-ROM. Contains
full annotated text of the novel (with a powerful "search" feature), the
full film "Nosferatu" (1922) with optional commentary by McNally, and a
wealth of information (illustrated) on vampire lore around the world and
the historical Dracula - Vlad the Impaler. "Dracubytes" you will not want
to miss!]

Melton, J. Gordon. _The Vampire Book: The Encyclopedia of the Undead_. 
Detroit: Invisible Ink, 1994.
[By far the most comprehensive book of its kind. Though marked by minor 
errors and inconsistencies, it is a "must" for your Dracula library.]

Melton, J. Gordon. _VideoHound's Vampires on Video_. Detroit: Visible Ink,
1997.
[A very comprehensive listing of vampire films available on video. Melton
reviews and rates over 600 vampire movies, and includes numerous sidebars
on topics ranging from the best vampire movies of all time to favorite
female vampires. A "must" for the video aficionado.]

Miller, Elizabeth (ed). _Dracula: The Shade and the Shadow_.
Westcliff-on-Sea: Desert Island Books, 1998.
[A collection of 20 edited papers from "Dracula 97", held in Los Angeles
in August 1997. For details on contents, see elsewhere on this site.]

Miller, Elizabeth. _Reflections on Dracula_. White Rock BC: Transylvania
Press, 1997.
[A collection of ten essays by Miller ranging from the scholarly ("Dracula
and Shakespeare") to the familiar ("Life as a Dracula Aficionado). For
full details, see elsewhere on this page.]

Riccardo, Martin. _Vampires Unearthed_. New York: Garland, 1983.
[A comprehensive bibliography of vampires in fiction and non-fiction, 
movies and magazines; very useful for serious researchers.]

Roth, Phyllis. _Bram Stoker_. Boston: Twayne, 1982.
[If you are looking for an overview of the life and works of Bram Stoker, 
including _Dracula_, this is a good place to start.]

Senf, Carol. _Dracula: Between Tradition and Modernism_. Twayne, 1998.
[A reading of the novel that places it clearly in the context of late
Victorian England. A very useful resource for university students.]

Senf, Carol. _The Vampire in Nineteenth-Century English Literature_.
Bowling Green: Popular Press, 1988.
[Provides a comprehensive summary of pre-Dracula vampire fiction, and an
excellent analysis of _Dracula_.]

Skal, David. _Hollywood Gothic_. New York: Norton, 1990. [The most 
comprehensive survey of Dracula on stage and screen.]

Skal, David. _V is for Vampire_. New York: Plume, 1996.
[A useful compendium of vampire/Dracula information, arranged
alphabetically. It is not an encyclopedia, but a subjective (and often
humorous) take on the genre. Most helpful are the entries on movies and
stage plays.]

Treptow, Kurt (ed). _Dracula: Essays on the Life and Times of Vlad 
Tepes_. East European Monographs, 1991.
[An excellent collection of essays on the historical Dracula.]

Wolf, Leonard. _Dracula: A Connoisseur's Guide_. Broadway Books, 1997.
[This new release by Wolf contains much of the material from his earlier
works, but also draws on recent research into Bram Stoker, the novel, and
vampire legends.]

Wolf, Leonard (ed). _The Essential Dracula_. Penguin, 1993. [This 
edition of Stoker's novel is unique in that it provides annotations that 
are not only interesting but, at times, entertaining. A rare combination!]

Wolf, Leonard. _A Dream of Dracula_. Boston: Little, Brown, 1972.
[The first major work to look at _Dracula_ from a psychosexual
perspective. While the book is a bit rambling, it is quite useful and is
still a landmark in Dracula studies.]
