<?case intro:?>
	<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
	
	<p>My first trip to Romania took place in 1994. It was the result of my growing interest in <I>Dracula</I>,
	the novel by Bram Stoker, and the historical Dracula, Vlad the Impaler. The tour that I took that
	summer was a package offered by Carpati International in New York. It included the sites
	associated with Vlad: Tirgoviste, Poenari, Brasov, Sighisoara, and Snagov, as well as the Stoker
	locations (Bistritz and the Borgo Pass). As a further attraction, it took in the Painted Monasteries
	of Moldavia, the city of Suceava, the Bicaz Gorge, Sibiu, and Bucharest.</p>
	
	<p>Since that summer, I have returned to Romania four more times. In 1995, I was a guest of the
	Transylvanian Society of Dracula (with headquarters in Bucharest) for its first World Dracula
	Congress, a conference which attracted scholars from around the world and included a tour along
	with the presentation of papers. In 1996 I attended a Dracula Symposium and visited the
	Maramures region of northeastern Transylvania, and spent some extra time in the Poenari region
	(Curtes-de-Arges and Arefu). In 1997, my primary destination was Cluj, where I gave a paper at
	the International Congress of Romanian Studies. The most recent trip, in 1998, saw me returning
	to some of my favorite locations: Arefu, Poenari, Sighisoara, Bostritz and Borgo Pass.</p>
	
	<p>While Romania has much more to offer the visitor than Dracula sites (for example, the Painted
	Monasteries of Moldavia), my intention here is to focus on those locations clearly identified with
	the historical Dracula, whose name Bram Stoker borrowed for his world-famous vampire Count.
	<P>I have combined the experiences from all 5 visits and divided my account into two sections. All
	of the photos in this section are my own.</p>
	
	<p>For a more complete discussion of the issues related to Romanian tourism focusing on Dracula, I
	refer you to Chapter 5 of my book REFLECTIONS ON DRACULA.</p>
	
	<p>First it is important to note that in Romania, Vlad is usually referred to as Vlad Tepes ("Tepes"
	meaning "the Impaler") rather than Vlad Dracula (though the name "Dracula" was used in
	several historical documents including a few written by Vlad himself). He is for many
	Romanians an important figure in their history, indeed a hero, primarily because of his successful
	military exploits against the Ottoman Turks who overran much of southeastern Europe.</p>
	
	<p><IMG src="assets/images/hmpage3.jpg" width="139" height="173" align="left">
	There are streets named after  him (I saw two - one in Brasov and one in
	Ploesti), there are monuments to him such as this one located at Corbeni
	near Poenari (in the Arges district). Others include one at Tirgoviste, and
	an impressive bust in the main foyer of the National History Museum in
	Bucharest, and so forth). In fact, the Museum in Bucharest has a room
	devoted to Vlad. In 1976, the Romanian government issued a
	commemorative stamp on the occasion of the 500th anniversary of Vlad's
	death, while in 1978 a Romanian studio released a feature film entitled
	"Vlad Tepes".</p>

<h2>And now for the sites, arranged in historical sequence.</h2>

<?case cozia:?>

	<h2>COZIA:</h2>

	<p>Cozia is a small village in a beautiful location in the Olt Valley, on the main highway linking
	Transylvania and Wallachia (between Sibiu and Rimnicu Vilcea). It is famous for its monastery, a
	Byzantine structure which was built in 1386 by Mircea the Old, grandfather of Vlad Tepes. Inside
	the church is the tomb of Mircea and a fresco which depicts him and one of his sons. The son on the
	fresco is Mihail, the only one of  Mircea's brood who was "legitimate" (Vlad, our Dracula's father,
	was one of many "illegitimate" sons).</p>

	<p>Mircea is considered one of the earliest prominent princes of Wallachia, a member of the Basarab
	family, of distinguished lineage. He (Mircea) did his share of fighting against the Turks, but was
	finally forced to recognize Turkish supremacy. However, he was able to retain a degree of  autonomy
	for his principality and is thus still regarded a national hero. He died in 1418 and is buried at Cozia.
	His bust is also on display along with that of his grandson (Vlad Tepes) at the National History
	Museum in Bucharest.</p>

<?case sighisoara:?>
	<h2>SIGHISOARA:</h2>
	
	<p><IMG src="assets/images/hmpage2.jpg" width="139" height="99" align="left">
	The visit to Sighisoara was one of the highlights of my trips. This
	Transylvanian town has a very well preserved medieval citadel which
	contains in its main square the house where Vlad Tepes was born (on photo
	"Casa Vlad Dracul" is the yellow/brown house on the left of the courtyard).
	On the outside of the house is a plaque which reads (in translation): "In this 
	house lived between the years 1431 -1435 the ruler of Wallachia Vlad
	Dracul son of Mircea the Old". The upstairs portion of the house where there was once the Receiving
	Room has been converted into a restaurant. There is a fascinating thing on the upper corner of one
	of the walls - a part of a mural that was recently discovered under another layer of covering. It shows
	a figure that experts believe is Vlad Dracul. If this is so, it is the only known visual representation
	of him. Eventually work will be continued to see how extensive this old mural is. It was also in 1431
	that Vlad (the father) was awarded the Order of the Dragon and became known by the sobriquet
	"Dracul". At that time he was military governor of Transylvania but was later to become prince
	(voivode) of Wallachia, the position that had formerly been held by his father Mircea.</p>

<?break;?>

<?case tirgoviste:?>
	<h2>TIRGOVISTE:</h2>
	
	<p>When Vlad Dracula first became Voivode of Wallachia (briefly) in 1448, the capital of the
	principality was Tirgoviste. About 80 km northwest of Bucharest, Tirgoviste  is of great interest to
	the Dracula enthusiast because of the remains of Vlad's palace that can still be seen there. It was at
	Tirgoviste, during Vlad's longest period in power (from 1456-62) that he committed many of the
	atrocities attributed to him in various historical documents. [One needs to bear in mind that many
	of these accounts were written by his enemies and therefore could have been exaggerated.]</p>
	
	<p><IMG src="assets/images/hmpage1.jpg" width="138" height="97" align="left">
	The best known episode associated with the palace at Tirgoviste is the
	seizing of the "boyars" at the Easter celebrations. Vlad blamed the nobles of
	Tirgoviste for the death of his older brother (Mircea had been buried alive
	by some of the citizens several years earlier). He invited all the nobles and
	their family to an Easter feast, after which he seized them, impaled the old
	and the very young, and put the rest into forced labor building his fortified
	castle on the Arges River (more about that castle later). There is a tower among the ruins at the
	Tirgoviste palace, on which is the lookout ledge where Vlad Tepes would watch the impalements
	in the courtyard below. Other events associated with that palace include the nailing of caps to the
	heads of the two ambassadors, the incident of the extra ducat, and the golden cup - and numerous
	others.</p>
	
	<p>Quite near the palace ruins, on the side of a main street in Tirgoviste, is a bust of Vlad Tepes, an
	indication of his important place in history. And it was at Tirgoviste that the former Communist
	dictator of Romania (Ceaucescu) and his wife were executed in  December of 1989.</p>

<?case brancastle:?>
	<h2>BRAN CASTLE:</h2>
	
	<p>Bran Castle is the most famous "Dracula" site having no significant connection with Dracula! I am
	including it because so many visitors to Romania have been (and still are) under the impression that 
	it is "Dracula's Castle". Located near the Transylvanian city of Brasov, in the southern range of the
	Carpathians,  it is an impressive medieval castle. But there is only a minimal connection between
	this castle and Vlad Tepes (he may have stayed there briefly on one of his excursions into
	Transylvania or may even have been held there briefly by Matthias Corvinus, but it certainly was
	not his castle and he never lived there. As for any connection with the Count Dracula of Stoker's
	novel, there is absolutely none.</p>
	
	<p>As for the reasons for this confusion, I suspect there are two: Bran Castle is a complete edifice that
	LOOKS like it should be Dracula's Castle (while the real one, as we shall see, is a ruin); and Bran
	is near the main tourist trade - near Poiana Brasov etc (while the real one is in a much more
	inaccessible location). At the World Dracula Congress in 1995, the curator at Bran offered another
	explanation. The castle was for decades presented to western tourists who came to Romania insisting
	on seeing "Dracula's Castle". This is what they were presented with. The misconception lingers to
	this day and is reinforced by the fact that the merchandise stalls at the foot of Bran are the best
	source of Dracula souvenirs in Romania! Of course, Bran attracts hundreds of visitors a day (it is on
	all of the standard tour routes) while the actual castle/fortress of Vlad (at Poenari), off the beaten
	track, draws only a few.</p>

<?case poenari:?>
	<h2>POENARI:</h2>
	<IMG src="assets/images/hmpage6.jpg" width="138" height="97" align="left">
	<p>If there is an edifice that can be labelled Vlad Dracula's castle, it is the ruins of Poenari. Actually,
	this is a fortress ("cetate" in Romanian) rather than a castle, located at the entrance to the gorge of
	the Arges River, north of the town of Curtea de Arges. As you leave Curtea de Arges (itself an
	interesting town with fortifications dating back to the 13th century and Basarab 1), you drive over
	a secondary road through several little villages, proceeding up the Arges valley towards the base
	of the Carpathian range.The road reaches the base of a group of high,
	heavily wooded mountains and there on the rocky top of one of them is
	Cetatea Poenari - Dracula's Castle. Even from the road  below it is a
	forbidding sight. What strikes one is its inaccessibility, high on a mountain
	top and the entrance to the gorges of the river (the river, by the way, has
	been diverted by a hydro-electric project). Poenari was the castle
	fortification that Vlad Tepes forced the nobles of Tirgoviste to build. The nobles were forced to walk
	the distance from Tirgoviste to the Arges (quite considerable by road -  probably about 60 km
	overland) and then drag the material up that mountain to build the castle.</p>
	<table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0"><tr valign="top"><td>
	<p>To get to the top, one has to walk up almost 1500 steps. But the effort is
	certainly worth it. As you approach the magnificent ruin (last 50 steps or so) 
	the scene is totally Gothic. There is the outline of the castle perched on the
	top of this rock, seeming to grow out of the very mountain itself. It covers
	the full space at the top, has a sheer drop on three sides, and is barely
	accessible by a small bridge near the top of the steps.</p>
	</td><td>
	<IMG src="assets/images/bridge.jpg" width="138" height="195" align="left">
	</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>
	<p>I have returned to this site three times, as it is one of my favorite places in
	Romania: not only because of the sense of history but the magnificent
	scenery. One particular view (looking northwest)
	is spectacular - just the
	way you might picture the landscape around Dracula's Castle in Stoker's
	novel (though Stoker knew nothing about this place).</p>
	
	<p>This is the route that, according to local legend, Vlad took in order to escape
	into Transylvania from the Turks in 1462. He was assisted in his efforts by
	the villagers of nearby Arefu, where many narratives about Vlad still live in
	their oral culture.</p>

	<p>Then there is the southern wall of the castle - a sheer drop!</p>
	
	<p>This is where, according to another local legend, Vlad Tepes' first wife flung
	herself, committing suicide rather than being taken captive by the advancing
	Turks. This castle is where Vlad would go for refuge in the face of
	advancing enemies. And from its towers he had a commanding view of
	anyone approaching from any direction. It was practically impenetrable.</p>

<?case snagov:?>
	<h2>SNAGOV</h2>
	
	<p><IMG src="assets/images/hmpage4.jpg" width="138" height="183" align="left">
	Lake Snagov  is located just about 20 miles or so north of Bucharest. The
	monastery is on an island in the middle of the lake, accessible only by boat.
	The Snagov Monastery is traditionally believed to be the burial place of
	Vlad Tepes., though there is not complete agreement about whether this is
	the case.</p>
	
	<br clear="all">
	
	<p><IMG src="assets/images/hmpage5.jpg" width="138" height="96" align="left">
	According to some historical accounts, his headless body was taken to the
	monastery and buried in front of the altar. The spot is clearly marked with
	a small portrait of Vlad, and a vase of fresh flowers - another indication of
	his stature as a national hero. This was the site that was excavated in 1931
	by Rosetti &amp; Florescu, only to find that there was no coffin, no body, only
	a few animal bones! Where was (is) Vlad Tepes? There are two main
	theories. One is that his body was later moved to a place near the  entrance of the chapel where a
	body was actually found, though positive  identification was difficult. This body has since
	disappeared. Another theory is that he is in the original place (near the altar) but further down. There
	is talk of another excavation. But for now, the whereabouts of Vlad's remains is a mystery.</p>

<?case conclustion:?>
	<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
	
	<p><IMG src="assets/images/gall7.gif" width="138" height="195" align="left">
	A portrait of Vlad Tepes hangs on the wall of a classroom at the village
	school in Arefu. This is a reminder of the fact that he is considered to be one
	of the heroes of the country's history. While many in the West may find this
	strange, we need to keep in mind that Vlad defended his small principality
	of Wallachia from the mighty armies of the Sultan of Turkey (Vlad was, in
	essence, a David fighting a Goliath) at a time when the Ottoman Empire was
	a powerful force in Eastern Europe and the Balkans.</p>
