Want to go to Romania and see Dracula sites for yourself?

Here are a few suggestions and recommendations.

If you are looking for a package that includes your airfare from North 
America as well as an in-Romania tour package, you should consult with 
your travel agent. You might also contact the web sites that I have 
included in my "Interesting Links" section of this page. I personally 
would recommend tours in Romania that are conducted by (or affiliated 
with) the Transylvanian Society of Dracula. These tours include sites 
connected with the two Dracula figures - the fictional Count of Stoker's 
novel and the historical Dracula - Vlad Tepes. The TSD tours offer you 
significant insight into Romania, its history, its people and its culture. 
This is, in my opinion, important, because Romamia is MUCH MORE than just 
the "country of Dracula". The TSD tours also emphasize the distinction 
between the two Draculas - between the vampire legends that Stoker 
incorporates and the historical reality (Vlad). I also consider that to 
be important.
