<B>Canadian Chapter</B><BR><BR><BR><BR>
<P>NEWS FLASH: The Canadian Chapter is now accepting American members!
<P>The Transylvanian Society of Dracula, a non-profit, non-political world-wide group, is a
historical-cultural organization with headquarters in Bucharest, Romania. It was founded in 1991,
following the fall of Communism, to promote contacts between scholars in Romania and the West
and to encourage Dracula tourism based on educational objectives.
<P>The Canadian Chapter of the Transylvanian Society of Dracula was formed in July of 1995,
following the first World Dracula Congress in Romania. It is open to all
CANADIANS and AMERICANS (and residents of countries where there is no
active chapter) who have a serious interest in the Dracula
of fiction and/or history. We do not consider ourselves a "fan club" but rather a forum for
scholarly interest in the subject.
<P>Upon joining, new members receive a leather membership card and a silver pin (the "D" logo as
above), issued by the central office of the Society in Romania. The Canadian Chapter publishes a
newsletter, <I>The Borgo Post</I>, 5-6 times a year, and an annual
Journal. Members are also provided with a Membership Directory as well as
access to the Chapter Library and materials in the research archive. The
Chapter was co-organizer of "Dracula 97", a major convention held in
Los Angeles in 1997, and will be participating fully in "Dracula 2000" to
be held in Romania.<BR><BR>
