<H2>What are the origins of Count Dracula?</H2>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<P>
The very first appearance of "Count Dracula" is in Bram Stoker's novel
<P>
DRACULA (1897).
<BR>
<BR>
<P>
But Stoker did not make up the name "Dracula".
<BR>
<BR>
<P>
There was a Dracula in the 15th century: Vlad the Impaler. Stoker didn't
<P>
know much about him (at least I don't think he did) but he came across his
<P>
name in a book he was researching entitled AN ACCOUNT OF THE
<P>
PRINCIPALITIES OF WALLACHIA AND MOLDAVIA (1820). This book has a very
<P>
short section on a "Voivode Dracula" who fought against the Turks. What
<P>
attracted Stoker to the name "Dracula" was a footnote by Wilkinson which
<P>
stated that "Dracula in the Wallachian language means devil". Not quite
<P>
accurate, but that is what Stoker saw and copied into his notes. He was
<P>
originally going to call his vampire "Count Wampyr" but changed it to
<P>
"Count Dracula." This change is clearly made in Stoker's own notes for
<P>
DRACULA which are located at the Rosenbach Museum in Philadelphia.
<BR>
<BR>
<P>
The real Dracula (about whom we know much more than Stoker ever did) was
<P>
NOT a Count, nor was he a vampire (or ever associated with vampires). The
<P>
two Draculas have become greatly confused in many people's minds.
<BR>
<BR>
<P>
It is my contention that Stoker was not, as many think, inspired by
<P>
accounts of Vlad the Impaler to create the character of Count Dracula.
<P>
There is no evidence for that view. I explore this fully in Chapter 1 of
<P>
my book <A HREF="<?echo$link;?>html/reflect.html">REFLECTIONS ON DRACULA</A>

<P>
Count Dracula, of course, was not the first vampire. Vampires had existed
<P>
in folklore and legend for hundreds of years, back to ancient times.
<P>
Stoker came across some information about vampire beliefs in Transylvania
<P>
which he used in the novel. He was also familiar with earlier vampire
<P>
literature written in English during the 19th century.
