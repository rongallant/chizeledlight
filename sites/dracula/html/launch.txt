               BOOK LAUNCHED IN TRANSYLVANIA



Elizabeth Miller, Professor of English at Memorial University, has just
returned from Romania where her new book _Reflections on Dracula_ was
officially launched. The event, filmed by Romanian national television,
took place at the Castle Dracula Hotel in the Borgo Pass (Transylvania),
home of the fictional Count Dracula of Bram Stoker's 1897 novel. It was
held at the conclusion of a symposium sponsored by the Transylvanian
Society of Dracula, a cultural- historical organization based in Romania
with chapters in several countries (including Canada).
