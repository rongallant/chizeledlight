A REPORT ON "DRACULA 97" (Los Angeles, 14-17 August 1997)
<P>
DRACULA 97 was a unique event in that it combined the features of
a scholarly conference with those of a fan convention - with a few other
things added in! It began on Thursday August 14 (mid-afternoon) and
concluded late afternoon on Sunday August 17.
<P>
The idea for "Dracula 97" was conceived, appropriately, in a Dublin pub.
Gordon Melton, Elizabeth Miller and Jeanne Youngson were all in the Irish
capital in June 1994 to attend a conference on Bram Stoker. As we sat
around one evening in a local pub, we raised the issue of some event to
mark the centennial year of the publication of Stoker's novel. The result
was "Dracula 97".

BEGINNINGS (August 14)
<P>
While "Dracula 97" did not officially begin until late afternoon,
registration got underway shortly after mid-day. By 2, the feeding frenzy
began at "Drac's Marketplace", the largest collection of Dracula/vampire
items for sale ever gathered in one place. In fact, the merchandise was
spread over three rooms, with 30 booths. "Drac's Marketplace" was set up
under the auspices of Del & Sue Howison of "Dark Delicacies" (Burbank, CA)
and was one of the popular meeting places at the Convention.

<P>
Also starting on Thursday afternoon was the "Dracula 97" Film Festival,
organized by Julia Winden Fey. This  offered screenings of several
well-known (and a few not so well-known) Dracula and vampire films.
<P>
THE ARRIVAL OF THE COUNT
<P>
Late afternoon on Thursday, four hearses pulled up in front of the Westin
Hotel (LAX). From one of them, a casket was carried in stately manner into
the hotel, through the main lobby, past the "Dracula 97" Registration
desk, to the atrium near the Ballroom. It was then placed upright, while a
sonorous voice invited Dracula to step forth and partake of his birthday
celebration. The coffin opened and Count Dracula emerged! The Centennial
Celebration was officially underway.
<P>
OPENING CEREMONIES
<P>
As the attendees gathered in the Ballroom, they were entertained by Barry
Fisher's Dracmaniacs with their unique brand of Transylvanian music.
<P>
"Dracula 97" officially opened with a procession of guests of honor,
celebrities, and organizers. Leading the group into the Ballroom was
ELVIRA, escorted by J. Gordon Melton and Elizabeth Miller.
Other guests of honor on hand for the opening ceremonies were:
<P>
Gahan Wilson (cartoonist) who acted as Toastmaster
        Fred Saberhagen (author)
        Robert Eighteen-Bisang (publisher)
<P>
Gahan Wilson introduced Convention Chair, J. Gordon Melton, who welcomed
all attendees on behalf of the organizers. Well-known film scholar David
J. Skal then proceeded to the entertainment segment. Elvira took the stage
and entertained the audience with a lively and humorous routine, followed
by a specially prepared video of a history of Dracula at the movies
entitled "Dracula in the Cinema" (created by Les Perkins).
<P>
The next person brought to the stage was a very special guest, Bela Lugosi
Jr, the son of the most famous "Dracula" of them all. During a short
interview with Skal, Lugosi shared impressions he had as a boy growing up
with such a famous father.
<P>
Then Skal brought on two very special guests, both of whom were connected
with 1931 Dracula movies. What a treat it was for the audience to see and
hear from two veterans: Carla Laemmle, who spoke the very first words in a
Dracula movie (as the young girl in the coach in Universal's 1931
"Dracula" with Bela Lugosi) and Lupita Tovar, who played Mina in the
Spanish version of "Dracula", also made in 1931 using the same sets at the
Lugosi film.
<P>
In the final segment of the program, a number of awards were presented by
the Transylvanian Society of Dracula, represented on stage by Nicolae
Paduraru, International President (Romania) and Baroness Elizabeth Miller
(President, Canadian Chapter). (A list of winners can be found on a
separate link.)
<P>
Following the program, many of the attendees drifted off to the hotel Bar
to imbibe Bloody Marys and Vampire Wine.
