<h2>Bram Stoker's Whitby</h2>

<p>
<em>"The houses of the old town...are all red-roofed, and seemed piled up one
over the other..."</em> So wrote Bram Stoker in his famous novel 'Dracula'.</p>

<p>Whitby is a town of about 14,000 located on the North Sea about 50 miles
northeast of York, England, on the edge of the famous North York Moors. The town, a fishing
port and a vacation resort, is on a rugged coastline at the mouth of  the River Esk. The river
mouth as it opens into the North Sea provides an excellent harbor which divides the town into
two parts (East and West) connected by a bridge. Whitby is famous as the place from which
Captain Cook sailed, on ships built in the town. A monument to Cook is a prominent feature of
the town.</p>

<p>What is the connection between Whitby and <I>Dracula</I>? First of all, Whitby figures quite centrally
in a significant section of the novel <I>Dracula</I> (Chapters 6-8). It is where the Russian ship
"Demeter" comes ashore and is the location of the first encounters between Dracula and Lucy.
Today, there are many points of interest for the Dracula enthusiast in Whitby.</p>

<p>One of the highlights is the Bram Stoker Memorial seat. It was the view from this spot that
inspired Stoker's Whitby scenes. One can look straight across the harbor and can see the ruins of
the Abbey, the Church, and the stone steps. And just to the left is the cliff where the "Demeter"
came ashore. There is an inscription on the bench which reads as follows: "The view from this
spot inspired Bram Stoker (1847-1912) to use Whitby as the setting of part of his world-famous
novel DRACULA. This seat was erected by Scarborough Borough Council and the Dracula
Society to mark the 68th Anniversary of Stoker's death - April 20th 1980".</p>

The most prominent landmark in Whitby is the ruin of Whitby Abbey,
which was sacked by the Danes. As Stoker writes, "It is a most noble ruin,
of immense size, and full of beautiful and romantic bits.... Between it and
the town there is another church, the parish one, round which is a big
graveyard, all full of tombstones".</p>

<p>It was at Whitby that Stoker "discovered" the name "Dracula." While vacationing there in the
summer of 1890, just months after he began writing his vampire novel, he visited the local library
and borrowed a book entitled <I>An Account of the Principalities of Wallachia and Moldavia</I>
(1820) by William Wilkinson. He took several notes from it (now part of his papers housed at the
Rosenbach Museum in Philadelphia.) Wilkinson's book includes a short section on a "voivode
Dracula" who fought against the Turks. Though the information was sketchy, one item attracted
Stoker's attention (he copied it verbatim into his notes): a footnote that "Dracula in the
Wallachian language means Devil." Stoker decided to change the name of his vampire Count from
"Wampyr" to "Dracula". An inspired decision!</p>
