<HR><B>Commentary on the performance by Elizabeth Miller</B>
<BR>
<BR>
<P>[I should point out at first that I am not a great fan of the ballet. I have attended probably only 5
or 6 ballet performances in my life and I hardly consider myself a critic of the art form. But what
I am lacking in that area I make up for (I hope) in my familiarity with Dracula. It is from that
perspective that I write this commentary.]
<BR>
<BR>
<P>Let me begin by saying that what I liked most about this production was that it was a cross
between ballet and theatre. The lead dancers acted as well as danced, and movements on stage
were choreographed with both in mind. Consequently one had a strong sense of narrative as well
as visual spectacle. And the narrative that was projected through dance, movement, facial
expressions, body language and sets was that of Stoker's novel. The choreographer obviously
knows the novel well, and chose to use it, rather than countless Dracula movies, as his source of
inspiration. There were a couple of points when I could detect the influence of the films (such as 
letting in the sunlight and having the Count destroyed with a wooden stake). But the story as
Stoker told it is what controlled the "narrative" of the dance.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<P><B>ACT 1</B> opens with Lucy front stage, frozen. Introductory text is projected to set the story: arrival
of Demeter in Whitby, Lucy's condition, her suitors and Dr Van Helsing's role. Then Dracula
comes from behind out of the darkness and takes Lucy with his dark kiss. One Winnipeg critic
noted that this happens too early, that there should be more of a preamble. I disagree. Unlike the
initial readers of Stoker's novel, we know what a vampire does to his victim, so the suspense is
not as essential an element. The focus in this production is on the aftermath - how, in this case,
Lucy responds to Dracula's influence and the futile attempts of her friends to counteract it.
<BR>
<BR>
<P>Scene changes into Lucy's room. [I was impressed at how scene changes were handled
throughout: they were done while the dancers continued, often in slow, fluid motion to give the
sense almost of a shape-shifting of the surroundings, providing an eerie feeling to what we were
looking at.] There are sequences of Lucy's illness, the arrival of the three suitors and Van
Helsing, Lucy's strange behavior, blood transfusions (an intravenous pas-de-deux), another visit
from Dracula, Van Helsing's consultation of his books, his use of garlic. Dracula at one point
shapeshifts into a bat, while gargoyles are creatively used to suggest the gradual overpowering of
Lucy by the forces of darkness. Lucy's death, funeral and resurrection as vampire follow in
succession, and we are treated to a superb dance sequence with Dracula (seducer) and Lucy
(pliant victim). The scene ends with Lucy's second death.
<BR>
<BR>
<P><B>ACT 2</B> has two parts. The first is a brilliant set of "program notes": a plot summary of Stoker's
novel, with the dancers performing a pantomime (with touches of humor) while a voice-over
reads the summary. The pacing was crucial to the success of this piece, and it was flawless. This
alone is worth the full price of admission to the performance.
<BR>
<BR>
<P>From this we are treated to a bacchanal, inspired by the traditions of both classical and folk
dance. Led by the wolf (which emerged from the Dracula of the preceding scene), we are taken
through several aspects of Dracula and his seductive influence on the world. While one could be
tempted to suspect that this was included to give the "purists" of the ballet some of what they
would expect, it did lift the narrative element to a more archetypal level.
<BR>
<BR>
<P><B>ACT 3</B> returns us to the narrative, this time the focus being on Mina. She arrives at the Budapest
convent to be reunited with Jonathan. The antecedent action involving Jonathan (his stay at
Dracula's castle and his encounter with the three female vampires while a prisoner there) is
handled as a sort of "flashback" as Mina reads Jonathan's journal (in itself a nice touch, in light
of the epistolary style of Stoker's novel). Mina soon has her own meeting with Dracula and
begins to fall under his spell. Unlike Lucy, however, she seems more aware of what is happening
to her (just as in the novel) and has both the strength and intelligence to resist. The hunt climaxes
in the castle as Mina (the men are all somewhat incapacitated) overcomes Dracula's power
through sheer will. The dazed men revive, surround the Count, and destroy him.
<BR>
<BR>
<P>A superb rendering of Stoker's novel, the RWB's <B>Dracula</B> played to full houses for all seven
performances in Winnipeg. The company is now taking it on tour throughout Western Canada
(read on for details).

<P>RWB'S DRACULA SELLS OUT ALL PERFORMANCES
<BR>
<BR>
<P>(Winnipeg, Manitoba; October 26, 1998) - Eight performances.  Eight sold-out shows.  The
Royal Winnipeg Ballet's world premiere of Dracula could not have been a bigger success.  Both
audiences and critics raved about the new ballet.
<BR>
<BR>
<P>All performances played to sold-out houses at Winnipeg's Centennial Concert Hall, with 16,857
people making their way through the RWB's turnstiles from October 20 to 25.  Dracula also
helped the RWB to sell 4,259 subscriptions, over 1,000 more than the previous season.
<BR>
<BR>
<P>Audiences all week left the theatre buzzing about what they had just seen.  Following the student
matinee performance, children were hanging out of bus windows screaming, "We love you
Dracula."  And the critics were just as ebullient:
<BR>
<BR>
<P>"What Godden and his designer Paul Daigle have accomplished in terms of theatrical effect is
proof that imagination and ingenuity are more important than a fat wallet. The kids in the
Winnipeg audience squirmed with glee when Lucy got her head chopped off with a spade and as
for the death of Dracula...well, it's not fair to give away too much. Suffice it to say it's really
scary. With Dracula, the Royal Winnipeg Ballet has a genuine hit on its hands...an original,
made-in-Canada, full-length story ballet that combines wit, intelligence, theatricality and fine
dancing in one very entertaining package." (Michael Crabb, CBC Arts Report, October 26, 1998)
<BR>
<BR>
<P>"Utterly seduced...brilliantly conceived...there's a sensuality in Godden's dance that I find
absolutely startling.  This is a crowning achievement for a choreographic career." (Robert
Enright, CBC Radio, October 22, 1998)
<BR>
<BR>
<P>"The RWB's Dracula is not the horror story we've become accustomed to.  It's a mesmerizing,
intimate and multi-layered portrait of a deeply tortured soul, danced by Zhang Wei-Qiang, whose
vampire is both a picture of courtly elegance and menacing force. Symbolic of those nameless,
faceless fears that lurk in the shadows, ready to pounce, this Dracula is an ominous, elusive
power whose presence is as everlasting as Stoker's myth.  Accompanied by the appropriately
mysterious and foreboding music of Gustav Mahler, Dracula is the balletic spectacle dancegoers
expect from RWB.  Set and costume designer extraordinaire Paul Daigle has pulled out all the
stops, creating some eye-popping, non-traditional special effects and costumes. The overall effect
is a neo-classical work wrapped in an exciting, hip and unusual package." (Riva Harrison,
Winnipeg Sun, October 23, 1998)
<BR>
<BR>
<P>"Godden's choreography is varied; he's not afraid to incorporate just about any theatrical trick or
staging technique, right down to the flying bat - much to the delight of the audience.  One section
<P>narrated by actor Richard Hurst puts the dancers through an absolutely side-splitting quickie
review of the plot that's worth the admission price in itself. And the piece's movements are often
mesmerizing, at once powerful, sexual, grotesque - even animal. But there's also a large dose of
more traditional ballet movements echoing the classical overtones of the story.  Lucy (Tara
Birtwhistle) and Mina (CindyMarie Small) shine throughout the evening. In fact, it's hard to
separate the two - each dances with awe-inspiring artistic skill, acting ability, and technical
prowess." (Kim Coghill, Winnipeg Free Press, October 23, 1998).
