REFLECTIONS ON DRACULA  by Elizabeth Miller

from Transylvania Press


REFLECTIONS ON DRACULA is a collection of ten non-sequential essays
written by Elizabeth Miller (with the exception of one, co-authored by
Margaret L. Carter). The essays draw on Miller's broad experience as both
a scholar and an aficionado. Five focus on Stoker's novel, while the
others five examine questions of context and influence.
