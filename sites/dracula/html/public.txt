The following is a list my published (or soon to be published) works,
as well as a list of papers that I have given at conferences. I am 
including only material on Dracula/Gothic literature written by me
since 1994. [Before that, my scholarly work - including several books 
and dozens of articles and reviews - was in the field of Newfoundland 
literature.] As a separate category, I am adding items (mostly newspaper 
coverage) that have been written about my work.
