The hardest thing to do in the wilderness is to find and capture food when you don't have the proper equipment. During this course you will learn how to identify different animal tracks, where to find them and how to follow them. You will also learn how to create the right trap for each animal, also using the surroundings, and where to place them. As well, you will learn how to clean the animals and use all parts so that nothing is wasted and you gain more needed equipment.<BR><BR>
