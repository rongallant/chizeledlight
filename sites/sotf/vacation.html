Looking for the ultimate adventure vacation for you and your friends or employees? Then look no further. Survival of the Fittest presents the Hunt for Endurance.<P>
It will consist of two or more teams of four to five people and one of my employees (not as a guide, but as a team member, just for safety reasons). Each team will start at a specific point in the wilderness and plot there own courses to a designated finish point (a cabin). The trek will be approximately 30 km. through the wilderness, over and around rivers, streams, pond, hills, etc… and each team will have to rely on each other for survival, for ex. One person will be in charge of navigation, another will be in charge of cooking, another in charge of shelter, another in charge of the fire and fire wood. Again one of my employees will be with each team as a team member, not as a guide or leader. This person will be there for safety reasons, incase some one becomes injured or lost, etc…The first team to reach the finish point (the cabin) wins the challenge. Upon reaching the cabin they will have a fresh change of cloths, food, and a place where they can wash waiting for them.<P>
For this challenge, these teams will have all equipment and transportation to and from the exercise area provided, all they have to provide is there food, clothing, and enthusiasm.
