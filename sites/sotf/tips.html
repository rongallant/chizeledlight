<B>People often ask us for advice on what to do in certain situations, and for tips and ideas. So for all you people, here it is, our very own Survival Tips page.</B>
</OL>
	<LI><B>Foot wear</B>
</OL>Your boots must be comfortable. If buying a pair, make sure they fit right, and don't let anyone tell you that you have to break them in to be comfortable. They should be comfortable from the start, then once they are broken in, they will fit perfectly.
</OL></B>

	<LI><B>Keeping your gear dry</B>
</OL>Try putting a garbage bag inside of your backpack, and placing your gear inside the bag. This will keep your stuff from getting wet, even if your backpack is exsposed to water.</FONT><P>
	
	<LI><B>Care for your tent</B>
</OL>The more a tent is in the sun, the less amount of time it will remain water resistant. Ultraviolet light damages the nylon. To avoid this, spray or coat you fly in silicone after every 10-15 days of use.</FONT><P>
	
	<LI><B>Caring for rope</B>
</OL>Never step on rope, it will ground dirt and sand into the fibres and weaken it.</FONT><P>
